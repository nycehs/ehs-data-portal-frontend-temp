      <description>Big improvements in outdoor air quality during COVID-19 reveal impacts of traffic and commercial cooking On March 20, 2020, New York State announced the COVID-19 shutdown, officially known as NY Pause. In NYC, it lasted until June 8, 2020.
With stay-at-home orders in NY and other states, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air quality changed significantly. Earlier, we looked at data collected from real-time air pollution monitors to see how day-to-day pollution changed when people started to stay home.</description>

      <description>NYC&amp;rsquo;s air quality is generally good and has been improving over time. But hour to hour, there&amp;rsquo;s large variation in our air quality - even in neighborhoods with the cleanest air. That means that for short periods, some New Yorkers are exposed to high levels of pollutants.
Fine particles (PM2.5) are among the most harmful pollutants. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to an estimated 2,300 excess deaths from lung and heart disease each year in NYC (1 out of every 20 deaths in NYC), and short-term exposure contributes to asthma incidents severe enough to require a trip to the emergency department, as well as other health threats.</description>

      <description>Imagine your child has asthma. One summer night, a powerful storm rolls in and knocks the power out.
Your child starts to have trouble breathing. Usually, you’d use a home nebulizer, an electric machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that your child breathes in through a face mask.
But the power is out. Without the nebulizer, your child’s breathing gets worse - and you wonder, is it time to go to the hospital again?</description>

      <description>Extreme heat is dangerous. It can cause illness, make chronic conditions worse, and even kill. Heat-related illnesses happen when the body cannot cool down enough, and include heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, fainting and heat stroke, the most serious form of heat-related illness. Heat can exacerbate chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases or kidney conditions, that may not be recognized or labeled as heat-related.
The weather forecast is the best way to predict heat-related health outcomes.</description>

      <guid>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/key-topics/airquality/aqe/</guid>
      <description>We combine data from our air quality monitoring network, NYCCAS, with other data to understand what makes one neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s air quality different from another&amp;rsquo;s. We found that building emissions, building density, industrial areas, and traffic density are associated with differences in air quality.
If we don&amp;rsquo;t have an air quality monitor in one neighborhood, but we know its building density, its industrial area, and its traffic, then we can model (estimate or predict) its air quality - based on monitored air quality in similar neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>In New York City and across the country, more people die from extreme heat than from all other natural disasters combined. To understand how to keep New Yorkers safe from extreme heat, we studied neighborhood factors that affect temperature, and found that grass, shrubs, and trees can play a major role. Let’s take a look.
At 6.00 PM on June 30, 2018, the air temperature at the LaGuardia Airport Weather Station was 89° Fahrenheit (F).</description>

      <description>Physical inactivity and unhealthy diet rank among the leading risk factors for premature death in the United States. Active design promotes health by using architectural and urban design strategies to encourage stair climbing, walking, bicycling, transit use, active recreation and healthy eating.
What we can do:
 Increase access to public parks and recreation. Create pedestrian plazas. Ensure well-maintained sidewalks. Plant street trees. Provide secure bicycle storage. Make stairways in buildings attractive and accessible.</description>

      <description>Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.
Like many cities, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants, particulate matter andground-level ozone, are of particular health concern.
Although New York City&amp;rsquo;s air does not currently meet federal air quality standards, it has improved significantly over the past two decades.</description>

      <description>Bed bugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.</description>

      <description>Birth defects (also called congenital malformations) are conditions that happen when a baby does not develop normally during pregnancy. Structural defects may include missing limbs, malformed hearts, spina bifida and genetic conditions like Down syndrome. Most birth defects happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life. Some birth defects (such as cleft lip or clubfoot) are easy to see, but others (such as heart defects or hearing loss) are found using special tests (such as x-rays, CT scans, or hearing tests).</description>

      <description>Close to 125,000 live births occur in New York City (NYC) each year. Most babies are born healthy, but those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk of disability or death. This site tracks indicators of fetal growth and development, infant and perinatal mortality, fertility and sex ratio at birth.
Birth Outcomes and the Environment Because many genetic and lifestyle factors influence growth and development of fetuses and babies, it can be difficult for researchers to study the effects of environmental exposures on birth outcomes.</description>

      <description>Cancer begins when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, but they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Leukemia (cancer of the blood-forming cells) is the most common form of childhood cancer. There are different kinds of childhood leukemia. The most common kinds are acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Brain and other nervous system cancers are the second most common types of childhood cancers.</description>

      <description>A region&amp;rsquo;s climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions, seasons, and patterns in extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes.
The world’s climate is shifting, becoming warmer with more precipitation and weather extremes. Over the past century in New York City, average temperatures have increased by 0.25°F per decade, precipitation by 0.72 inches per decade, and sea levels by 1.2 inches per decade. By the 2020s, a projected 25-30 days above 90°F are expected in a typical summer, resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves.</description>

      <description>There is broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity is changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate through increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) — primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) — in the atmosphere.
Scientists have predicted that unless GHG emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible.
A key part of combating climate change is mitigation, which means reducing GHG emissions.</description>

      <description>Cockroaches, or just &amp;ldquo;roaches&amp;rdquo;, are a common urban pest. Though there are more than a thousand species of roaches, just a few are found in NYC homes. The most common are American Cockroaches, typically found in moist basements and lower floors, and German Cockroaches, found anywhere inside homes.
Cockroaches like warm, dark places such as toasters, clocks, microwave ovens, walls, and cabinets. They need regular access to food and water to live and breed.</description>

      <description>All NYC residences receive drinking water from a public water system. Most water is gravity fed from a network of reservoirs and lakes in protected watersheds, up to 125 miles from the city (view map).
The NYC water system consists of two surface water systems (Croton and Catskill/Delaware) and a Southwestern Queens ground water system. Since 1999, the Croton system has served as a supplemental water system, and the Catskill/Delaware reservoir system has supplied almost all NYC drinking water.</description>

      <description>Each year, one in three older adults (65 years and older) falls. Among New York City&amp;rsquo;s older adults, there are approximately 30,500 emergency department (ED) visits, 16,600 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths each year. Falls are not a normal part of aging, and research shows that many falls can be prevented.
Falls and the environment Although falls can occur anywhere, falls among older adults frequently happen at home. More than one-half of fall-related hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home.</description>

      <description>Air pollution is an important environmental threat to the health of New York City residents. Exposures to two common air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), can worsen respiratory illness and heart conditions and contribute to premature deaths. Older adults, children and people with existing heart and lung disease are especially affected. This site provides estimates of the impact of air pollution on the health of NYC residents as measured by the numbers of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to PM2.</description>

      <description>A heart attack is referred to medically as an acute myocardial infarction. It is caused when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart is severely reduced or cut off altogether. Without adequate blood flow, heart cells can quickly become injured or die. Most heart attacks are an acute event that follows years of atherosclerosis - a build up of plaque in the arteries around the heart. Factors in the environment may contribute to both atherosclerosis and to the acute event itself.</description>

      <description>No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing. All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury.
In New York City, substandard or poor housing tends to cluster in neighborhoods. Homes that are deteriorating or dilapidated, or homes near buildings with broken or boarded-up windows, disproportionately tend to be in low-income neighborhoods, although the differences for these indicators have decreased.
Housing and Health Housing quality impacts health directly and indirectly.</description>

      <guid>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/lead-hazards/</guid>
      <description>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978. Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips, peels or is abraded, or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust.</description>

      <description>Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.
Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.
This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings.</description>

      <description>Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, long-term weight gain, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional value, and because they don’t fill you up the way food does, you end up consuming more calories. Also, food and beverage portion sizes have exploded over the past several decades, and studies have shown that when given larger portions, people consume more without recognizing it.</description>

      <description>Traffic injuries are no accident. Like other public health concerns, they are preventable through data driven solutions. In NYC, traffic injuries, which include injuries among pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and motor vehicle occupants, are a leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits.
In February 2014, NYC launched “Vision Zero”, an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets. Vision Zero is a multi-agency effort, incorporating road engineering, traffic enforcement, community outreach and education, and policy work to make NYC streets safer.</description>

      <description>Vectorborne diseasesare diseases that are transmitted from an arthropod (usually a tick or mosquito, etc.) to humans or other animals. Some vectorborne disease agents are maintained primarily through transmission between arthropods and humans (e.g., dengue virus and malaria), while others are maintained between arthropods and animal reservoirs (e.g., Lyme disease and West Nile virus) and humans may become infected incidentally.

      <description>Violence is the use of physical, verbal, and/or emotional force to injure, harm, abuse, damage, or destroy. Interpersonal violence includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse. Violence can involve injury to self, including self-harm, suicide attempts, and death by suicide. Violence can also take the form of power against a group or community.
Violence is a public health issue because it is a cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to physical and emotional harm, an increase in negative health outcomes, premature death, psychological trauma and persistent fear to individuals and communities.</description>

      <description>OneNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.
Goal: Improve the quality of our waterways to increase opportunities for recreation and to restore coastal ecosystems.
New York State sets water quality standards, and NYC monitors New York Harbor water quality on an annual basis through the Harbor Survey. The survey uses 36 stations located throughout the open waters of the harbor and 19 stations located in smaller tributaries within the city.</description>

      <description>A region&amp;rsquo;s climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions, seasons, and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes. New York City (NYC) faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms. With climate change, the severity of some of these risks will increase. A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) report predicts that by the 2020s, average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 2.</description>

      <description>Every year in New York City, workers are injured on the job or become ill as a result of exposure to health hazards at work. However, most work-related illnesses and injuries are preventable – safer work environments can be achieved when workplace hazards are understood and appropriate prevention measures are put in place.
Data on work-related injuries and illness are used to show how often these preventable events occur and to identify factors that place workers at risk.</description>

      <description>As city life changes, so does its air quality, as sources of emissions that affect the city&amp;rsquo;s outdoor air quality, like truck traffic, building boilers and restaurants, also change. For more than a decade, we have been tracking air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) and exploring the factors that drive neighborhood differences. We have found some interesting changes in the sources of air pollution across NYC neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>Using public health to prevent violence Experiencing violence affects people in many ways. It not only causes physical injury or death, but being exposed to it can also cause emotional and psychological trauma. Violence doesn’t just affect the immediate victim, it affects their surrounding community, too.
Violence can affect people throughout their lives: it is associated with worse birth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths.</description>

      <description>Inside the 90-year-old financial policy that harms our health In public health, we often cite structural racism to help explain health patterns in our society. But what, specifically, does this mean? A close look at the history of redlining shows this connection.
When we analyze data on the health of New Yorkers, we often find the same geographic patterns, with higher rates of preventable health conditions in high-poverty neighborhoods. For example, we&amp;rsquo;ve written about how asthma and poverty are closely connected.</description>

But you may not think about how your home affects your health - and you may not think about the factors that influence where you live. For a home to be healthy, it should be free of:  Cracks Holes Leaks Smoke Pests Old, peeling paint  In other words, a healthy home is a well-maintained home.</description>

      <description>The COVID-19 public health emergency has changed New York City in many ways - including how we get around the city. As the city continues to adapt to COVID-19, New Yorkers will look for ways to get around that feel safe - redistributing transit among different modes to ease crowding and increase safety on public transportation. As more New Yorkers use bicycles, let&#39;s take a look at safety on our streets.</description>

      <description>Hot weather is dangerous. In New York City and across the country, more people on average die from extreme heat each year than from all other natural disasters.
Heat stress happens when your body’s temperature increases quickly. When the body can no longer control its temperature or cool itself down, it can lead to death.
At the NYC Health Department, we track heat stress deaths by reviewing causes of death recorded by the Bureau of Vital Statistics.</description>

      <description>New York City has hundreds of neighborhoods and nearly as many ways of drawing neighborhood boundaries. When you visit the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, you might notice that data is available in several different neighborhood schemes.
For example, dig around in the asthma data pages and you&amp;rsquo;ll find Adults with Asthma presented by UHF34 neighborhoods, Public School Children with Asthma presented by UHF42 neighborhoods, and Asthma emergency department visits are offered by NTAs.</description>

      <description>What happens when NYC stays home? The COVID-19 pandemic upended the lives of all New Yorkers. The outbreak has affected many aspects of our daily life, but there are also less apparent effects, such as impacts on our environment.
The NYC Community Air Survey uses air quality monitors to take hourly measurements of fine particulate (PM2.5) at a few sites around the city.
Generally, locations around the city see changes in PM2.</description>

      <description>Violence has profound effects. An assault, a shooting, a homicide, or any use of force affects people in many deep ways.
Violence causes physical and emotional harm. It can inflict fear, a constant sense of unease. It can cause short- and long-term trauma. Violence can affect people throughout their lives - including their health. It can lead to poor birth outcomes, compromised childhood development, negative health behaviors, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths.</description>

A few months ago, when we redesigned the home page of the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, we wrote that we were working toward &amp;ldquo;building a system that works: that’s intuitive and makes our information clear and easy-to-find.&amp;rdquo;
As a government agency, we&amp;rsquo;re committed to making information available via the web. By doing this well, we hope that people can use this information to change their lives and their communities.</description>

      <description>Does the air improve in car-free zones? People often ask us this, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great question. To answer, we turn to the NYC Community Air Survey, or NYCCAS. NYCCAS is our network of air quality monitors around the city.
NYCCAS monitors air with nearly 100 sensors across the city  NYCCAS air quality monitor sites: Routine site, environmental justice site, retired site. We use these monitors to measure levels of six different pollutants: fine particles (PM2.</description>

      <description>In Part 1, we looked at data from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) - a network of about 100 air quality monitors - to see if air quality improves in areas that go car-free. And the answer is yes.
NYCCAS tells us that more traffic means more air pollution nearby. So, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t have a nearby monitor, we can predict that an area that goes car-free (like Park Drive in Prospect Park, for example) sees an improvement in air quality.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve kept most of the Portal&amp;rsquo;s functions the same, but we&amp;rsquo;ve rearranged things, and want to tell you about them.
Before After Why&amp;rsquo;d we make these changes? Well, for a few reasons:
To highlight our best tools and resources. We want our home page to make it clear what this site is all about, and draw attention to our top tools: our Data Explorer, Neighborhood Reports, and Data Stories.</description>

      <description>New Yorkers eat out more than a billion times a year. To help keep diners safe, the Health Department educates restaurant operators about food safety practices and inspects all 27,000 city restaurants at least once a year. Over 90 percent of NYC restaurants have &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; grades in the window, showing excellent compliance with food safety requirements.
However, warmer weather creates special challenges keeping food safe. We dug into the data to find out how hot weather affects food safety.</description>
