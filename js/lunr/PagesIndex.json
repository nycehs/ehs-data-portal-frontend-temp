tests Birth defects can vary from mild to severe This site provides data on NYC children born with one or more of 12 major birth defects Each of the 12 birth defects is defined in the glossary on this site The data comes from the NYS Department of Health Congenital Malformations Registryhttpwwwhealthstatenyusdiseasescongenitalmalformationscmrhomehtm Birth Defects and the Environment Scientists believe most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors including our genes behaviors and environment However the causes of most birth defects are unknown The fetus is more sensitive to exposures than an adult and if exposures happen during important periods of development birth defects may result Although there has been some research into how environmental exposures might cause birth defects there is still much more work that needs to be done to understand the relationship of these exposures to birth defects Known and probable risk factors for birth defects include the following smoking use of alcohol and other drugs poor nutrition andor health such as low levels of folic acid obesity and poorly controlled diabetes some medicines prescription overthecounter toxic chemicals such as lead paint and paint thinner gasoline pesticides and secondhand smoke infectious agents such as rubella and toxoplasmosis and ionizing radiation xrays About the Data and Indicators Collecting and sharing good data about the occurrence of birth defects is a first step in understanding how they might be related to the environment Looking at patterns of birth defect rates can help health officials plan services and create ideas for research into environmental causes of birth defects All birth defects in any child less than two years old are reportable under New York State law to the State Congenital Malformations Registry Most birth defect reports are abstracted from inpatient hospital records since birth defects diagnosed on an outpatient basis are not well reported Accurate hospital clinical recognition of birth defects depends on clinical expertise and interest This is particularly true of conditions more difficult to diagnose As a result identification of birth defects may vary by area and by time Areas with hospitals that provide higher levels of care may have more thorough diagnoses and thus apparently higher rates Similarly areas with hospitals that report cases more completely will also appear to have higher rates Prevention Not all birth defects can be prevented but actions that increase the chance of having a healthy baby include Have regular medical checkups and check with a provider before taking any medications Eat healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight avoid alcohol and dont use street drugs Make sure that medical conditions like diabetes are under control Take a vitamin with folic acid before and during pregnancy Quit smoking and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke Damaged leadcontaining paint in homes should be safely addressed by properly trained workers ideally prior to pregnancy Pregnant women and small children should stay out of the home until lead paint projects are completed Employers should provide workplaces free from unsafe chemical exposures and provide protective gear to workers when necessary To learn more about the chemicals at work employees can ask their employer for the Material Safety Data Sheetshttpa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicGlossaryaspxMaterialSafetyDataSheets for the products used Key Messages About one out of every 33 babies is born with a birth defect A birth defect can affect almost any part of the body The well being of the child who is born with a birth defect depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved how much it is affected and the quality of rehabilitative support received in early childhood Heart defects make up about onethird to onefourth of all birth defects affecting about one in every 100 to 200 births Some of these heart defects can

        "content": "A regions climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions seasons and patterns in extreme weather events like heat waves droughts and hurricanes The worlds climate is shifting becoming warmer with more precipitation and weather extremes Over the past century in New York City average temperatures have increased by 025F per decade precipitation by 072 inches per decade and sea levels by 12 inches per decade By the 2020s a projected 2530 days above 90F are expected in a typical summer resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase by up to 5 together with another 10 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NYC Panel on Climate Change Climate Risk Information 2009 Climate and Health Even without long term changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While less common coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 from their devastating direct costs in over 1800 lives along the Gulf Coast to longterm mental health consequences among survivors In 2011 Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in US history though New York City was largely spared The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure lack of air conditioning inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults 65 years and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or other cognitive impairment Some medications can increase heat risk talk to your doctor or pharmacist to learn more about medicationrelated risk and precautions to take during hot weather For air conditioners with a thermostat a setting of 78F is recommended to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on those atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Seek medical attention immediately if the victim has a rapid heart rate trouble breathing is no longer sweating displays very unusual behavior or loses consciousness Being prepared is key to weathering hurricanes and coastal storms safely Find out if you live in an evacuation zone and stay tuned to TV and radio evacuation messages when a storm approaches Information can be found at wwwnycgov by searching Hurricane Zones or by calling 311 Have a Go Bag ready for evacuation with copies of IDs and insurance cards bottled water and nonperishable snacks a list of medications and dosages doctors phone numbers a first aid kit extra keys a flashlight and battery operated radio and small personal or family care items Keep emergency supplies ready at home to shelter in place if directed a threeday supply of drinking water and nonperishable foods first aid kit flashlight battery operated radio and extra batteries whistle iodine tablets or eyedropper and plain bleach for disinfecting water if directed and a batteryoperated phone Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use While heatrelated mortality rates are overall substantially lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning a notorious heat wave in 1896 killed approximately 1500 NYC residents we may begin to see a reversal in this trend as a result of rising temperatures depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom are at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health"

        "content": "All NYC residences receive drinking water from a public water system Most water is gravity fed from a network of reservoirs and lakes in protected watersheds up to 125 miles from the city view maphttpwwwnycgovhtmldephtmldrinkingwaterwsmapswideshtml The NYC water system consists of two surface water systems Croton and CatskillDelaware and a Southwestern Queens ground water system Since 1999 the Croton system has served as a supplemental water system and the CatskillDelaware reservoir system has supplied almost all NYC drinking water We display data on disinfection byproducts nitrates and arsenic in NYC drinking water because these contaminants occur most frequently at levels that may be of public health significance in drinking water nationwide Additional contaminants of emerging concern nationwide have either not been detected or detected at very low levels in the NYC drinking water system These include atrazine di2ethylhexylphthalate DEHP tetrachloroethylene PCE trichloroethylene TCE radium and uranium According to the NYC DEPhttpwwwnycgovhtmldephtmldrinkingwaterleadindexshtml drinking water enters the NYC water system virtually leadfreeThe DEP then uses anticorrosion methods to reduce the leaching of any lead that may be present in plumbing fixtures solder or pipes that connect the water system to the thousands of buildings in NYC Federal regulations require that lead testing of water is done at the tap of a sample NYC buildings each year In 2015 90 of those samples tested below the action level of 15 gL More detailed data on NYC drinking water quality and lead testing procedures and results can be found herehttpwwwnycgovhtmldephtmldrinkingwaterwsstateshtml Drinking Water Quality and Health Drinking water in NYC is monitored regularly for biological and chemical contaminants for the purpose of protecting public health and checking compliance with state and federal rules Monitoring drinking water is important because contamination in a single system could expose many people at once People can be exposed to contaminants in drinking water not only by drinking the water but also by eating foods prepared with the water breathing water droplets or chemicals released from the water while showering or by absorbing chemicals through their skin while bathing Drinking water is disinfected to reduce the possibility of illness from microorganisms Disinfection byproducts DBPs are chemicals that can form when a disinfectant such as chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic matter and other substances in the source water Current research is investigating whether there are health effects from chronic exposure to the byproducts of water disinfection Nitrates are nitrogenoxygen molecules commonly found in water where nitrogenbased fertilizers are used nearby Decades ago it was discovered that infants who were fed formula made with water containing nitrates over 10 mgL sometimes became seriously ill due to the interference of nitrate with the oxygencarrying capacity of blood Arsenic is naturallyoccurring in groundwater systems in some parts of the US It may also enter drinking water systems as a result of past use of arseniccontaining pesticides and wood preservatives Chronic exposure may increase risk of certain cancers About the Data and Indicators The New York City Department of Environmental Protection DEPhttpwwwnycgovhtmldephtmlhomehomeshtml regularly samples analyzes and reports contaminant levels at the source and in the drinking water distribution system The data presented here provide summary measures of contaminants in drinking water sampled at many points in the distribution system DBPs are divided into two families total trihalomethanes chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and five haloacetic acids trichloroacetic acid dichloroacetic acid monochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid and monobromoacetic acid The maximum contaminant levels MCLshttpa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicGlossaryaspxMCL set by EPA are o Arsenic 10 gL o Nitrate 10 mgL o DBP Total Trihalomethanes TTHM 80 gL o DBP Haloacetic Acids HAA5 60 gL Prevention Most people do not need to take any actions to prevent waterrelated illnesses or health effects from drinking NYC water Though levels of contaminants are consistently very low in water that arrives to a building lead or leadsoldered plumbing in some older buildings may raise lead levels in water at the tap Reducing the possibility of exposure to lead in drinking water is simple and inexpensive Run your tap for at least 30 seconds until the water is noticeably colder before drinking cooking or making baby formula Free tap water quality tests are available by calling 311 Ultimately maintaining the highest quality drinking water depends on protecting our lakes rivers and aquifers from contamination Key Messages The quality of the drinking water in the NYC system is excellent The water systems serving NYC are consistently in compliance with EPA guidelines DBP concentrations show a seasonal effect with higher concentrations during the warm and rainy months when more organic material is in the water systems Arsenic levels are consistently very low in NYC Nitrate levels are also consistently low owing to the protection of upstate watersheds from farm runoff NYC drinking water has many advantages over bottled water or processed beverages its sources are known its purity is checked it is not stored in plastics it does not get shipped into the City using trucks that pollute our air it costs little or nothing and it is caloriefree"

and quality of our transportation network To measure progress towards this goal we are tracking the switch to more sustainable modes of transportation modal shift and mass transit capacity as well as whether our transportation system is meeting a state of good repair Modal Shift We are tracking the extent to which people are using nonautomobile modes of transit including public transportation eg bus subway bicycling and walking These alternative modes which use less land and create less pollution than automobiles result in less congestion and increased mobility for NYC residents To quantify the extent of the modal shift in NYC we measure the way people travel to the central business district Manhattan below 60th street as well as the way people travel citywide For travel to the central business district we look directly at changes in the percent of all trips that use nonautomobile modes of transit To track the switch to mass transit citywide we look at the relative growth of auto and transit travel demand Travel demand is highly correlated to economic activity during recessions it tends to go down and during periods of economic growth it increases To control for this economic impact we measure the relative changes in use of transit including nonmotorized travel and automobiles from the year 2000 Our goal is to increase the mass transit and nonmotorized share of travel in NYC both to the central business district and citywide Transit Capacity Increasing transit capacity will reduce traffic congestion by allowing more people to take mass transit To measure whether NYC has increased capacity we are tracking the number of transit vehicle revenue miles in the New York metropolitan area Vehicle revenue miles are miles that transit vehicles eg subway cars buses are scheduled or travel while in revenue service They do not include miles traveled without passengers or when returning to a storage depot Noncity agencies provide significant transit service to and from the city eg Long Island Rail Road Metro North Rail Road New Jersey Transit so we have included them in our computation We have also included all modes of mass transit eg bus tram ferry rail subway paratransit vehicles to ensure a complete view of transit capacity State of Good Repair Bridges and Roads NYC owns and maintains 786 bridges and related structures In the 70s and 80s the dire financial situation led to decisions to defer bridge maintenance which in turn led to declining conditions Today we apply lifecycle analyses to make strategic investments in maintenance and component replacement The approach has yielded better bridge conditions and longer life expectancy for some bridges which will both save NYC money in the long run and provide the highest safety and service for our customers The NYC Department of Transportation NYC DOT has spent 3 billion in capital construction on city bridges since 2000 With stepped up maintenance it has led to the near elimination of bridges in poor condition and an increase in bridges rated good or very good The NYC DOT goal under this program is to have all of its bridges rated in very good good or fair condition and none rated poor Bridges in fair condition or better receive routine maintenance and component replacement As they approach the low end of fair bridges are reconstructed or rehabilitated This is the most costeffective approach for the longterm maintenance of city bridges NYC DOT also tracks the road network on a biannual basis Street conditions are assessed on a scale of 110 Ratings of 7 or above indicate good condition while ratings below 7 qualify a street for resurfacing or reconstruction A certain number of streets will also be below 7 because of utility work or other issues unrelated to the road itself The goal is to have at least 85 of city streets rated at or above 7 which assumes that the remaining 15 can be scheduled for resurfacing within the next two years This translates to about 1050 lane miles resurfaced each year State of Good Repair Subway stations NYC Transits 468 passenger stations are used by millions of customers each day The system has 277 underground stations 142 on elevated structures and 49 on viaduct embankment or opencut structures In 2008 NYC Transit completed a comprehensive condition survey of all stations conducted by independent engineering consultants Over 14500 components were rated on a scale of 1 best to 5 worst to identify structural and architectural defects Components rated 30 or worse are identified as needing repair Transits goal is to eliminate the most deficient conditions throughout the system within 15 years through a program of comprehensive and targeted componentbased station projects combined with coordinated maintenance strategies These investments will target components such as stairs and platform edges that most affect safety and the customer experience Investment in stations will be guided by an ongoing Condition Assessment Inspection Program and reevaluation of implementation approaches to improve efficiency and effectiveness of investments to benefit customers"

        "content": "A regions climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions seasons and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts and hurricanes New York City NYC faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms With climate change the severity of some of these risks will increase A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change NPCC report predicts that by the 2020s average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 20F to 30F compared to a 19712000 baseline Heat waves will become more frequent intense and longer in duration Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase together with another 48 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NPCC Climate Risk Information 2013 Weather and Health Even without longterm changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While far less common coastal storms can also have serious consequences including longterm mental health impacts In 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City and resulted in at least 44 deaths Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure and inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs in highrise buildings due to elevator outages Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat and coldrelated illnesses About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods The Tracking Portal also provides counts and rates of hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for cold stress As with heat stress data is important to note that cold stress data reflect only a portion of the overall health impact and does not account for potential increases in hospital visits for other conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease for example Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or cognitive impairments Set air conditioners to 78F or lowcool to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on family friends and neighbors atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Living without heat or being outdoors in cold weather for a prolonged time can be dangerous Stay indoors as much as possible When outdoors wear layers of warm clothing and cover exposed skin If your home lacks heat get to a warm place if you can and wear warm clothes Report loss of heat or hot water to property managers immediately and call 311 Seniors should take extra care outdoors to avoid slips and falls from icy conditions Protect yourself and your family from carbon monoxide CO poisoninghttpwww1nycgovassetsdohdownloadspdfpublicdohmhnews1001pdf Make sure your home has a working smoke alarm and CO detector If a CO detector goes off in your home immediately open a nearby window go outside for fresh air and call 911 NEVER run a vehicle inside a garage or against a snowbank Clear snow from your cars tailpipe before running the engine Check on neighbors friends and relatives For more information on preparing for weather hazards including heat cold coastal storms and power outages visit the DOHMH extreme weather websitehttpwww1nycgovsitedohhealthemergencypreparednessthreatspage Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use Although heatrelated mortality rates are lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning it is possible that rates may rise as a result of climate change depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom may be at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health People most likely to be exposed to dangerous cold include those who lack shelter work outdoors andor live in homes with malfunctioning or inadequate heat Seniors infants people with chronic cardiovascular or lung conditions people using alcohol or drugs and people with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions are at increased risk"

monitoring for environmental justice For 10 years the New York City Community Air Survey NYCCAS has measured air quality at 100 locations around NYC Weve combined these measurements with data on things related to air quality like traffic building emissions green space and much more to model seasonal air quality in every New York City neighborhood Our full findings are available in our annual report but here are a few other interesting things weve found along the way Additional health threats of traffic volume Traffic is a part of life in New York City and urban areas around the world While transportation is critical to a healthy functioning city it can also contribute to poor health and quality of life for both commuters and residents NYCCAS air monitoring data shows that traffic is associated with higher levels of harmful pollutants NO2 PM25 and black carbon BC In addition studies show that traffic is associated with two more health threats air toxics and noise Air toxics Air toxics are air pollutants that increase the risk of cancer and other serious health effects A study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that 49 of New York City residents live in census tracts that exceed a common benchmark for cancer risk because of exposure to benzene and formaldehyde compared with 48 of the population nationwide To further understand New Yorkers exposure to these air toxics we measured air toxics including benzene formaldehyde and other compounds at 70 sites across the city in 2011 We found that average levels of benzene and formaldehyde varied across NYC with some sites showing two three or even six times more air toxics than cleaner sites mostly due to traffic volume congestion and fuelburning buildings functionuse

tdocumentgetElementByIddatawrapperchartedocumentquerySelectoriframesrcettstyleheightadatadatawrapperheightepx Noise City residents are exposed to significant environmental noise A Health Department survey showed that one in five adult New Yorkers experience noise that disrupts sleep and other home life three or more times per week and some highpoverty neighborhoods experience even greater rates of noise disruption Noise is more than an annoyance it can cause stress increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and interfere with cognitive development in children To measure noise levels we collected weeklong sound pressure measurements at 56 sites across the city by mounting small soundlevel meters on lampposts in 2012 We found that for weeklong average values All sites exceeded noise guidelines set by the EPA and World Health Organization to protect health and quality of life 55 dBA Over half of sites exceeded EPA noise guidelines to prevent hearing loss 70 dBA The highest noise levels were recorded during the daytime hours of weekdays in areas where there was a lot of traffic within 100 meters Its no surprise that where there are high levels of noise there are also high levels of air pollution from vehicles Reducing emissions of both noise and air pollution from vehicles and other sources would improve health and quality of life in many of our most burdened neighborhoods functionuse strictwindowaddEventListenermessagefunctionaifvoid 0adatadatawrapperheightforvar e in adatadatawrapperheightvar tdocumentgetElementByIddatawrapperchartedocumentquerySelectoriframesrcettstyleheightadatadatawrapperheightepx The benefits of cleaner heating fuel With cold weather and high population density the Northeast is the nations largest consumer of heating oil We use these fuels year round in building boiler systems for heat and hot water New York City has been phasing out the dirtiest heating fuel with high amounts of sulfur through recent City and State regulations These heating fuel regulations will be fully implemented by 2030 NYCCAS data shows that neighborhoods with higher proportions of buildings that burn highsulfur heating oil have worse air pollution So how can we estimate the public health benefits of cleaner heating fuel To estimate the impact of those heating oil regulations we used model simulations Heres what we did We gathered emissions data using boiler permits and other buildings and emissions data to see how boiler emissions changed after the regulations were put in place We estimated the resulting change in PM25 concentration using a complex air quality computer model that combines emissions information meteorology data and simulations of atmospheric chemical reactions This map shows estimated reductions in PM25 by neighborhood from 2008 before the regulations took effect to 2030 when the regulations will be fully implemented functionuse

tdocumentgetElementByIddatawrapperchartedocumentquerySelectoriframesrcettstyleheightadatadatawrapperheightepx Then we estimated the health benefits of reduced exposure to air pollution We gathered neighborhoodlevel population and health outcome data and we estimated the health events like asthma deaths and more that New Yorkers avoided due to this cleaner air Heres what we found Mortality reductions in areas with the worst air quality Cleaner fuels will save the most lives in areas with the greatest reduction in PM25 and areas with the highest rates of baseline premature mortality These are the neighborhoods that already have poor air quality and high rates of death including the Upper East and West Sides and Northern Manhattan Fewer adverse health events throughout the city Cleaner fuels will result in reductions in other health events throughout the city notably in the Bronx and Brooklyn Even in neighborhoods with better air quality hospitalizations and emergency department visits for cardiovascular disease asthma emergency department visits and respiratory diseases will go down as PM25 levels drop In other words reducing PM25 benefits areas that have high PM25 but also communities with lower PM25 but high rates of respiratory diseases You can explore these findings in the maps below Deaths Heart disease Asthma Respiratory disease functionuse

environmental justice Across public health research we see that communities with higher concentrations of poverty have higher rates of a variety of health conditions including health conditions that are sensitive to air pollution This makes people in these communities more vulnerable to harm from air pollution We make sure that our monitoring network accurately models air quality in highpoverty

        "content": "As city life changes so does its air quality as sources of emissions that affect the citys outdoor air quality like truck traffic building boilers and restaurants also change For more than a decade we have been tracking air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey NYCCAS and exploring the factors that drive neighborhood differences We have found some interesting changes in the sources of air pollution across NYC neighborhoods NYCCAS is the largest urban air monitoring program in the country We measure air pollution at nearly 100 locations around the city and use landuse and other emissions data in a statistical model to identify the factors most closely associated with different pollutants Lets look at PM25 or fine particles PM25 is the most harmful urban pollutant It can cause cancer worsen heart and lung disease and lead to premature death PM25 levels vary across the city and the pollutant comes from a lot of different sources the most important of which had been building boilers We have been able to accurately estimate or model PM25 concentrations by looking at data on building boilers which burn fossil fuels to generate heat and hot water and release PM25 PM25 is either emitted by combustion or form in the atmosphere out of other pollutants Its the most harmful air pollutant it gets into our lungs and bloodstream and worsens heart and lung disease You can see in the chart below that neighborhoods with high building density have reliably higher wintertime concentrations of PM25 than medium or lowdensity neighborhoods Since theres seasonal variation in PM25 concentration its easier to look at one season at a time You can also see that the wintertime PM25 concentrations have gone down dramatically over time largely because the city has required buildings to reduce emissions Local Law 43 of 2010 outlawed the burning of heavy fuel oil Number 6 in New York City buildings requiring buildings to switch to cleaner fuels In 2012 New York State lowered the allowed sulfur content of Number 2 fuel oil which further cleaned up building emissions Meanwhile emissions from another source commercial cooking has gone up according to emissions estimates Commercial cooking refers to cooking in restaurants especially meat cooked on grills or charbroilers The smoke this creates is vented out of the building and contributes to PM25 measured by NYCCAS The National Emissions Inventory NEI is a detailed estimate of air pollution emissions from all the sources of pollution including vehicles building heating commercial cooking construction factories and power plants among other manmade and natural sources The inventories include criteria pollutants like PM25 NO2 and ozone and hazardous air pollutants like mercury benzene and asbestos Learn more about the NEI We can see these trends in our PM25 landuse regression model which links neighborhood factors to measured pollution and allows us to estimate pollution levels in places where we dont measure it Our model tells us which emissions sources explain the differences across neighborhoods Pollutant levels can vary significantly from one neighborhood to another For example in 2018 the seasonal average PM25 concentration across NYCCAS monitoring sites ranged from 34 to 165 micrograms per cubic meter Get more air quality data at the NYCCAS Annual Report With the increase in commercial cooking emissions our model shows that the number of restaurants with permits for grills or charbroilers in a neighborhood is now a better predictor of PM25 concentrations than building density and explains most of the variation across the city What can we do about this In 2015 New York City took a step forward in addressing this pollutant source when City Council passed Local Law 38 which updated the NYC Air Code to include commercial cooking emissions Following input from an advisory committee made up of representatives from health and environmental organizations as well as the restaurant industry the New York City Department of Environmental Protection created regulations requiring the registration of commercial charbroilers and the installation of emissions control devices on new grills and charbroilers in restaurants that cook significant amounts of meat Like with building boiler emissions knowing where charbroilers are located will help us better understand the impact on neighborhood air quality With this information government and industry must think creatively about how to support all impacted restaurants large and small in reducing emissions from commercial cooking Together NYC can continue to clean up its air and protect the lungs of New Yorkers"

        "content": " Big improvements in outdoor air quality during COVID19 reveal impacts of traffic and commercial cooking On March 20 2020 New York State announced the COVID19 shutdown officially known as NY Pause In NYC it lasted until June 8 2020 With stayathome orders in NY and other states New York Citys air quality changed significantly Earlier we looked at data collected from realtime air pollution monitors to see how daytoday pollution changed when people started to stay home More recently we used data from our network of air quality monitors to examine air pollution changes over time and across neighborhoods During NY Pause there was less traffic at bridges and tunnelshttpsnewmtainfocoronavirusridership shorter travel times on major roadwayshttpsdevsocratacomfoundrydatacityofnewyorkusi4gitjb9 and fewer open small businesseshttpsgithubcomOpportunityInsightsEconomicTracker especially in leisure and hospitality As a result outdoor air quality improved we recorded large decreases in concentrations of pollutants Some of this decrease was expected since air quality is seasonal For example boilers that heat buildings in the winter emit pollutants so we usually see air quality improve when winter ends But the improvements in pollution from winter to spring were much greater in 2020 than they had been in 2019 Reductions in activity during NY Pause resulted in a 29 decline in NO2 and a 25 decline in PM25 Both NO2 and PM25 fell during NY Pause more than in 2019 functionuse

particles less than 25 microns in diameter PM25 is the most harmful urban air pollutant It is small enough to penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream which can worsen lung and heart disease The biggest air quality changes were in Manhattans central business district With many New Yorkers staying home activity in the CBD fell drastically Explore the changes in the maps below Our landuse regression models incorporate data from nearly 100 air quality monitoring sites For more information visit NYCCAS View these data in an interactive map Comparing Midtown Manhattan to an urban background location Since PM25 levels normally vary by season we used the difference in PM25 between a site in midtown Manhattan and an urban background site in Queens to see if there were any unusual changes during NY Pause This Queens site usually has lower levels of air pollutants than Midtown but during NY Pause the difference fell to nearly nothing Pollution in Midtown matched the Queens site Our landuse regression models suggest that there are three major sources of PM25 and NO2 in NYC traffic commercial cooking and building boiler emissions Traffic resumed after NY Pause During NY Pause the Lincoln Tunnels morning rush travel time to NYC plummeted indicating reduced traffic volume It increased again during the summer but many small businesses including restaurants stayed closed There were about 50 fewer small leisure and hospitality businesses operating during NY Pause than in January 2020but many of the small businesses that closed had still not reopened by January 2021 The other major source of air pollution in NYC building boilers showed little evidence of change during the shutdownhttpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS2666765722000072via3Dihub While traffic picked up again businesses were slow to reopen and Midtown PM25 levels stayed low Even after traffic picked up again PM25 levels in Midtown remained similar to the site in Queens This suggests that the changes in PM25 werent driven entirely by traffic levels in the CBD Instead decreases in PM25 were probably because small businessesin particular restaurantsremained closed That meant ongoing decreases in commercial cooking Because of restrictions on gatherings and indoor dining and fewer tourists and office workers restaurant emissions stayed lower than normal even after the city started reopening These data show us how the early stage of the COVID19 pandemic affected our air quality Different factors drove the changes the shutdown impacted both traffic emissions and restaurant emissions When people stay home air pollution decreases Lessons learned for the future Understanding the air pollution impacts from NY Pause can help us anticipate impacts from policies such as congestion pricing Congestion pricing is a proposed tolling system that would charge drivers for entering Manhattan below 60th street Because congestion pricing specifically targets traffic going into the CBD we can expect effects on air pollution to be more narrowly focused around that area And congestion pricing will probably have more of an effect on NO2 which mostly comes from traffic than on PM25 which comes from many sources including buildings and commercial cooking Air quality changes from Spring 2019 to Spring 2020 times PM25 NO2 Close function mapPM consolelogmap PM var iframe

vegaEmbedmap1spec United Hospital Fund neighborhoods United Hospital Fund neighborhoods UHFs have boundaries based on ZIP codes This geography was created by the Health Department the United Hospital Fund and other city agencies in the 1980s They were designed for health research and to be similar to NYCs Community Districts Health data like somebodys hospitalization record for example or a response to a survey often includes a persons ZIP code Its the most readily available piece of geographic information in administrative data Its also the neighborhood designation that most people know and can provide when responding to a survey To protect privacy we often bundle or aggregate data from a larger area so we need a scheme of neighborhoods that are made up of a collection of ZIP codes UHFs Collecting data by ZIP code and then rolling up into UHF neighborhoods has been used in health research for decades The methods for our surveys like the Community Health Survey are designed to include enough people from each UHF neighborhood so that theres a representative sample of all New Yorkers and so that we can compare neighborhoods with high statistical confidence Usually we use UHF42 neighborhoods which breaks the city down into 42 neighborhoods Sometimes though we use UHF34 neighborhoods by grouping together some of the neighborhoods we can increase the statistical power of a survey In the map below notice how three UHF42 neighborhoods in the South Bronx are combined into one UHF34 neigborhood and how the UHF neighborhoods have ZIP codes or more precisely ZIP code

straddles two different UHF neighborhoods We have a tool that helps you view the overlap and the differenceshttpsa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicCommunityDistrictaspx so that you can choose what Neighborhood Report to use but it still raises a difficult question what neighborhoods data would you bring to your Community Board meeting On the EH Data Portal we aggregate data from lots of different sources They might not line up exactly the way we want them to when data are collected in different ways for different purposes there will be differences in the underlying geography available The fact that theres no one consistent root unit does complicate things But any way of drawing boundaries or aggregating data will smooth over some variation within groups Despite limitations in the data we can still see health patterns by geography and learn valuable information about how neighborhoods differ and why Neighborhood health data have a lot to tell us even when their boundaries are imperfect representations of New York Citys communities"

        "content": "Hot weather is dangerous In New York City and across the country more people on average die from extreme heat each year than from all other natural disasters Heat stress happens when your bodys temperature increases quickly When the body can no longer control its temperature or cool itself down it can lead to death At the NYC Health Department we track heat stress deaths by reviewing causes of death recorded by the Bureau of Vital Statistics More people usually die of heat stress during hotter summers From 1999 to 2016 NYC had 4 spikes due to severe heat in 1999 2006 2011 and 2013 But deaths due to heat stress only tell part of the story Summer heat can also kill people by worsening chronic illnesses such as heart disease Since the effects of heat can be hard to recognize these are often not recorded as heatrelated deaths on death certificates We use statistical models to examine the difference between the average number of deaths during hot weather and the average number of deaths on typical cooler summer days That difference is called heatexacerbated mortalityhttpsnyccascityofnewyorkusnyccas2021webreport7 It is an estimate of the number of people who died because of heat even if heat is not included on their death certificate as a cause of death Heatexacerbated mortality Each year from 2010 to 2018 there were an average of 350 heatexacerbated deaths associated with days over 82F from May to September This is over 30 times greater than the number of deaths with heatrelated stress listed on the death certificate Of these 350 annual deaths about 100 28 are due to extreme heat events 2 or more days with a heat index of 95F or higher or one or more days reaching 100F or higher While extreme heat days are more rare the risk of death on these days is much higher than on other summer days But because there are many more days that are hot but not extreme we estimate that more deaths about 250 happen on summer days without extreme heat events What puts people at risk of heat stress We investigated heat stress deaths by looking at medical examiners records Of the 88 people who died from 2010 to 2019 whose records we reviewed 62 71 were exposed to the heat in their own homes What prevents heatrelated illness at home Air conditioning Of the records with information on home air conditioning none of those who died had a working air conditioner 90 of households in NYC report having an air conditioner but in some of NYCs lowincome neighborhoods this drops to as low as 76 Having an air conditioner is one thing but using it is another When we surveyed New YorkershttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC6069135 we found that 15 of New Yorkers have AC but dont use it during hot weather Of those 1 out of 4 said they dont use AC because of the cost of electricity Lowincome New Yorkers can apply to receive money from the State to buy an air conditionerhttpswww1nycgovsitehrahelpenergyassistancepage During the COVID19 public health emergency many households have experienced financial hardship Even as the City phases into recovery communities continue to cope with the spread of COVID19 steps to reduce risk and lasting economic impacts These may put people at greater risk for indoor heat exposure because they may be limiting contact with others by staying at home and limiting air conditioning to save money Access to air conditioning is an issue of climatehealth equity We expect more extreme heat events as our climate continues to warm so the Health Department is working to prepare our residents and communities Older adults are more likely to die from extreme heat because of being more likely to have chronic illnesses and economic concerns However Black New Yorkers die from heat at younger ages They are often younger when they develop chronic medical conditions and are more likely to have more than one condition Crucially longstanding systemic health and social inequities have put Black New Yorkers at increased risk of getting sick and dying from extreme heat Structural racism also results in higher unemployment rates fewer job opportunities lower pay and greater job instability for Black New Yorkers affecting financial stability We identified environmental housing and social factors that influence who is more likely to die from heat We used this to create the Heat Vulnerability Indexhttpsa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicHeatHubhvihtml to learn how heat risk changes across neighborhoods As we experience a changing climate air conditioning is no longer a luxury It is lifesaving equipment Yes we must use it responsibly to reduce contributions to climate change and protect the power grid But home cooling in the summer should be treated like heat in the winter necessary to survival particularly for those who are most at risk A healthy indoor temperature should not be a privilege limited to those who can afford to own and use an air conditioner especially when lacking one can be deadly"

tienen menos acceso a viviendas saludables La desigualdad actual data de una historia de racismo y negligencia una prctica conocida como redlining que result en segregacin y que a su vez condujo al mal estado de las viviendas y caus estas disparidades sanitarias Analicemos cmo sucedi esto El racismo ha determinado el lugar de residencia de las personas desde la poca colonial El racismo siempre ha desempeado un papel en los patrones residenciales de la ciudad de Nueva York Cuando la ciudad de Nueva York era una colonia holandesa ocupaba solo el extremo sur de Manhattan Wall Street recibi su nombre por el muro que protega la ciudad En 1661 cuando las personas negras le solicitaron a la colonia tierras en el rea recibieron las tierras ubicadas al norte del muro fuera de la ciudad propiamente dicha A lo largo de la historia muchas prcticas diferentes han moldeado los patrones raciales y residenciales en la ciudad de Nueva York En el siglo XX una prctica denominada redlining convirti al racismo en una poltica federal con repercusiones duraderas para nuestra situacin de vivienda y la salud La poltica federal impuls la segregacin residencial En la dcada de 1930 el gobierno federal desarroll mapas codificados por colores para dirigir los prstamos a posibles compradores de viviendas en los EE UU En la dcada de 1930 la Gran Depresin provoc una ola de ejecuciones hipotecarias en todo el pas Las tasas de desempleo eran altas y muchas personas no podan pagar su hipoteca Para ayudar a que las personas conservaran sus viviendas el gobierno federal estableci la Corporacin de Prstamos para Propietarios de Viviendas Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Su objetivo era refinanciar las hipotecas con mejores trminos menos intereses y perodos de compensacin ms prolongados Esto ayudara a las personas a efectuar los pagos y evitar las ejecuciones hipotecarias Sin embargo para determinar qu prstamos podan garantizar con seguridad la HOLC envi a personas a tasar vecindarios en las ciudades de los EE UU y cre los mapas discriminatorios de redlining que guiaran la industria inmobiliaria durante dcadas En estos mapas codificados por colores los vecindarios se dividan en 4 categoras Mejores An atractivos Definitivamente en declive Peligrosos Claramente esta clasificacin se originaba en el racismo ya que las descripciones de los vecindarios incluan declaraciones como la siguiente Influencias perjudiciales infiltracin de negros Razas mixtas El gobierno les negaba los prstamos a las personas negras y latinas que intentaban comprar viviendas en los vecindarios discriminados por el redlining En su lugar estos recursos se destinaron a comunidades suburbanas nuevas compuestas solo por personas blancas El mapa a continuacin muestra cmo se categorizaban los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York Esto era el redlining Este proceso se conoci como redlining denegar de forma sistemtica recursos pblicos y privados segn el lugar de residencia de las personas con la comunidad negra como objetivo El redlining ayud a impulsar la segregacin urbana en el siglo XX ya que los nuevos vecindarios se construan para las personas blancas mientras que las personas negras eran obligadas a vivir en vecindarios declarados en declive Debido al hecho de que ser propietario de una vivienda es una forma importante de acumular riqueza el redlining tambin impuls la desigualdad econmica ya que se les negaban a las personas negras las mismas oportunidades de propiedad que tenan los blancos Otras prcticas discriminatorias mantienen la segregacin Otras prcticas inmobiliarias como el acoso immobilarionbspla venta de contractos nbspy los convenios racialmente restrictivos han mantenido la segregacin El acoso inmobiliario era una prctica empleada por los agentes inmobiliarios Como muchas personas blancas consideraban a las personas negras una amenaza social y econmica para sus vecindarios los agentes les decan a los propietarios blancos que haba personas negras que estaban por mudarse al vecindario Esto convenca a los propietarios de que el valor de sus viviendas descendera y vendan las propiedades a un precio ms bajo Luego los agentes inmobiliarios les vendan las propiedades a las personas negras a precios excesivos La venta de contractosera una prctica inmobiliaria engaosa y explotadora que tena como objetivo a las personas negras con prstamos privados para comprar viviendas Estos prstamos solan tener tasas de inters altas y trminos manipuladores que en algunos casos obligaban al comprador a renunciar a la vivienda si dejaba pasar apenas un pago del prstamo Por lo general estos contratos hacan que las personas debieran pagar mucho ms dinero que el valor de la vivienda que compraban Un convenio racialmente restrictivo es una clusula en el ttulo de la propiedad que evita que el propietario les venda la vivienda a personas negras Los convenios racialmente restrictivos eran una manera de imponer la segregacin residencial para garantizar que las personas negras permanecieran fuera de los vecindarios blancos En la actualidad los defensores inmobiliarios sealan que algunos arrendadores continan con las prcticas discriminatorias y describen el comportamiento de un propietario de esta forma Este arrendador tiene el patrn de comprar edificios antiguos y desgastados en vecindarios negros de clase trabajadora deja que los apartamentos de los inquilinos a largo plazo se deterioren y los hace esperar meses para hacer reparaciones de baja calidad Muchos inquilinos tambin dicen que el arrendador tiene un trato preferencial con los inquilinos nuevos tomado de Coalicin de Derecho a un Consejo de la Ciudad de Nueva York Lista de los peores desalojadores Estas prcticas perpetan un legado de racismo edilicio mantienen la segregacin residencial y con el tiempo resultan en falta de inversin que se da cuando los vecindarios se ven privados de los recursos que sus residentes necesitan para estar saludables y tener oportunidades La falta de inversin condujo al mal estado de las viviendas Durante todo el siglo XX los vecindarios discriminados se deterioraron ya que no posean inversiones privadas ni recursos del gobierno Es menos probable que los arrendadores en estos vecindarios mantengan adecuadamente las viviendas Como resultado muchas viviendas tienen problemas de mantenimiento graves y crnicos

        "content": " For health place matters What determines whether or not youre healthy You may think about what you eat whether you exercise whether you smoke and your family medical history But you may not think about how your home affects your health and you may not think about the factors that influence where you live For a home to be healthy it should be free of Cracks Holes Leaks Smoke Pests Old peeling paint In other words a healthy home is a wellmaintained home But some buildings arent healthy places to live Buildings with maintenance issues and disrepair can harm health Across NYC lowincome neighborhoods have a higher percentage of buildings in disrepair and Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing Todays inequality can be traced to a history of racism and neglect a practice known as redlining resulted in segregation which in turn drove housing disrepair and led to these health disparities Lets explore how Racism has determined where people live since colonial times Racism has always played a role in residential patterns in New York City When New York City was a Dutch colony it was just the southern tip of Manhattan Wall Street got its name from the citys protective wall In 1661 when Black people petitioned the colony for land in the area they were given land north of the wall outside of the city proper Throughout history many different practices have shaped racial and residential patterns in New York City In the 20th century a practice called redlining made racism a federal policy with longlasting repercussions for our housing and our health Federal policy drove residential segregation In the 1930s the federal government developed colorcoded maps to guide loans to potential home buyers in cities across the US In the 1930s the Great Depression caused a wave of foreclosures throughout the country Unemployment rates were high and many people couldnt make mortgage payments To help keep people in their homes the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Its goal was to refinance mortgages with better terms less interest and a longer repayment times This would help people make payments and avoid foreclosure However to determine what loans they could safely guarantee HOLC sent people to appraise neighborhoods in cities across the USA and generated the discriminatory redlining maps that would guide the real estate industry for decades On these colorcoded maps neighborhoods were divided into 4 categories Best Still desirable Definitely declining Hazardous This classification was clearly rooted in racism since neighborhood descriptions included statements like Detrimental influences Infiltration of Negroes Mixed races The government denied loans to Black and Latino people trying to buy homes in redlined neighborhoods Instead these resources went to new Whiteonly suburban communities The map below shows how New York Citys neighborhoods were categorized This was redlining This process became known as redlining systematically denying public and private resources based on where people live targeting people of color Redlining helped drive urban segregation in the 20th century as new neighborhoods were built for white people while people of color were forced into neighborhoods declared to be declining Since homeownership is an important way to accrue wealth redlining drove economic inequality too by denying people of color the same opportunities for home ownership that white people had Other discriminatory practices maintain segregation Other real estate practices like BlockbustingnbspContract selling nbspRacially restrictive covenants have maintained segregation Blockbusting was a practice used by real estate agents Since many white people viewed people of color as a social and economic threat to their neighborhoods agents would tell white homeowners that people of color were about to move into the neighborhood This would convince homeowners that their houses value would fall and they would sell for a lower price Real estate agents would then turn around and sell property to people of color for inflated prices Contract selling was a deceptive and exploitative real estate practice that targeted people of color with private loans to buy homes These loans often had high interests rates and manipulative terms in some cases forcing the buyer to give up their home if they missed even one loan payment These contracts often made people responsible for paying back far more money than the house they bought was worth A raciallyrestrictive covenant is a clause in the deed for a property that prevents the owner from selling the property to people of color Raciallyrestrictive covenants were a way to enforce residential segregation to ensure that people of color were kept out of white neighborhoods Today housing advocates say that some landlords continue discriminatory practices describing one landlords behavior this way This landlord has a pattern of buying old worn out buildings in working class neighborhoods of color letting the apartments of longterm tenants fall into disrepair and making them wait months for lowquality repairs Many tenants also say that this landlord gives preferential treatment to new tenants from the Right to Counsel NYC Coalition Worst Evictors List These practices continue a legacy of housing racism maintain residential segregation and over time result in disinvestment when neighborhoods are deprived of resources that their residents need for health and opportunity Disinvestment led to housing disrepair Throughout the 20th century redlined neighborhoods deteriorated as they were deprived of private investment and government resources Landlords in these neighborhoods are less

far beyond inconvenience or mess Disrepair can harm health Healthy housing problems like maintenance deficiencies and general disrepair are associated with many adverse health outcomes General disrepair is associated with anxiety and depression Some forms like broken plaster and peeling paint or cracks and holes in interior walls can expose children to lead paint Water leaks broken windows or toilet breakdowns can introduce mold which triggers allergies asthma and can make chronic conditions worse Pests like cockroaches mice and rats can make asthma and allergies worse The lack of an air conditioner places people at risk of death during hot weather As a result of the segregation and disinvestment caused by redlining Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing They are more likely to live in buildings that have healththreatening maintenance issues These disparities persist across income levels Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing but this isnt due to higher poverty rates in these populations Black and Latino people with higher incomes are also more likely to live in buildings with serious maintenance issues further suggesting that

These healthy housing problems cant be fixed by a little bit of tidying up they stem from chronic neglect of maintenance by building management and landlords and old housing stock in disrepair after decades of disinvestment And the disparities in access to healthy housing are related to real estate practices that maintain segregation Racism and disinvestment show up in health data Disinvestment in neighborhoods of color leads to housing disrepair which in turn creates unhealthy homes Disrepair mold and pests trigger asthma attacks sending children with asthma to hospitals an often frightening experience for both children and their caregivers As a result the highest rates of asthma emergency department visits for children age 5 to 14 are in neighborhoods that are home largely to

        "content": "In New York City and across the country more people die from extreme heat than from all other natural disasters combined To understand how to keep New Yorkers safe from extreme heat we studied neighborhood factors that affect temperature and found that grass shrubs and trees can play a major role Lets take a look At 600 PM on June 30 2018 the air temperature at the LaGuardia Airport Weather Station was 89 Fahrenheit F At the same time the air temperature on a block in East Harlem below left was nearly 5 hotter than at the Weather Station and the temperature on a block in BedStuy below right was 35 hotter 100th St between Lexington and 3rd Ave Manhattan 939 F Stuyvesant Ave between Jefferson and Putnam Brooklyn 925 F This is an example of the Urban Heat Island Effect when some areas in a city are hotter than others Temperatures can even vary from block to block LaGuardia Airport is an open space without many structures surrounding it It doesnt trap heat the way other places in the city do so we often use it as a reference temperature It is almost always cooler than other parts of NYC where building boilers and vehicle engines generate heat manufactured surfaces like roofs and roads absorb heat and theres less vegetation to cool things down What cools your block Anyone who has looked for a shady spot under a tree on a hot sunny day knows that trees help to cool off a street But by how much How effective are trees at cooling neighborhoods and what other characteristics contribute to an areas air temperature during hot weather To find out how trees and other characteristics affect hyperlocal temperature blockbyblock differences we worked with the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Mayors Office of Climate and Resiliency to install air temperature monitors around the city This was part of a comprehensive approach to keep neighborhoods cooler during hot weather in NYC We reviewed landuse data and satellite imagery to build a profile of each block where we were monitoring temperature We found that temperature could vary significantly depending on block characteristics For example the block we studied in Brownsville Brooklyn had very little vegetation trees grass and shrubs while the block in Edenwald in the Bronx had high grass and tree coverage You can see the difference in vegetation coverage in these satellite images We found that the average temperature at the Edenwald spot was more than 2 cooler than the Brownsville spot Brownsville Brooklyn Measure Tree canopy Low Grassshrubs Low Building height Low Average temp 82 Edenwald the Bronx Measure Tree canopy High Grassshrubs High Building height Medium Average temp 798 These are the factors we explored that affect hyperlocal temperature Tree canopy coverage Total tree canopy coverage is the percent of the sidewalk in the right of way of the monitored street that is shaded by trees Trees provide shade and prevent the ground from heating up They also can cool the air through evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration happens when the suns rays hit plants causing water to evaporate from the leaves This change from liquid to vapor cools the plants just as sweating cools our bodies and uses energy thereby reducing the amount of energy left to warm the air Grass and shrubs The percent of grass and shrubs in front of buildings on the monitored street Grass and shrubs cool the air through shading and evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration happens when the suns rays hit plants causing water to evaporate from the leaves This change from liquid to vapor cools the plants just as sweating cools our bodies and uses energy thereby reducing the amount of energy left to warm the air Building height Our model looks at the median building height the middle of the range of sorted heights of buildings on the block Taller buildings can absorb and reflect more heat increasing the streets temperature but at about 3 or more floors begin to cool the street by shading it Impervious surfaces Impervious surfaces are made from asphalt concrete astroturf and even hardpacked dirt These surfaces absorb sunlight and reflect and retain heat They increase the temperature of the surrounding area Other factors Other factors like the orientation of the street NorthSouth or EastWest how close the area is to the ocean the elevation of the area daily wind speed and weather patterns can also influence how hot a block is What factors matter the most We built a statistical model that predicts the average summer temperature on a hypothetical city block based on the neighborhood factors we studied in the hyperlocal temperature study We modeled the average temperature from 6 to 9PM when the Urban Heat Island Effect is the greatest the sun sets but the city retains heat Our model looked at how much each factor affected temperature and it showed that the most important factor for reducing temperature was green space trees grass and shrubs reduce temperature Having more surfaces that hold heat increases temperature See for yourself drag the green slider back and forth to see what the temperature would be on a hypothetical block if there were more vegetation or more impervious surfaces like roadways which absorb sunlight and retain heat Impervious surfaces XX Change the ratio Vegetative material XX

A block covered in trees grass and shrubs might have an average summertime evening temperature of 77 but one completely covered in impervious surfaces would be 79 More vegetation means lower temperatures Cooling a block by 2 may not sound like much but small differences in temperature especially at peak summer temperatures really matter For example the average temperature at Central Park increased 34 from 1900 to 2013 Cooling blocks by just a few degrees can help offset the effects of climate change at the local level As the climate changes NYC faces rising average temperatures and heat waves that place New Yorkers at risk Already more than 100 New Yorkers die each year due to extreme heat Even modest cooling can save lives and cooling neighborhoods with trees and other

stretched from NYC to Ontario Canada affecting 55 million people Many areas including here in New York City were without power for days In New York City the power outage started around 410pm on the 14th a day when temperatures were in the 90s While the power was restored in some neighborhoods by early morning on the 15th full power for the entire city did not return until that evening That blackout was dangerous for NYC residents and we can see the effects in health data Hospitalizations for respiratory problems spiked above predicted levels The health impacts were not limited to just hospitalizations In fact the power outage was deadly In the chart below you can clearly see that observed deaths generally bounce around the level of predicted deaths staying within the prediction range But on and after the power outage observed deaths spiked more people died during and immediately after the power outage In the chart below you can clearly see that observed deaths generally bounce around the level of predicted deaths staying within the prediction range But on and after the power outage observed deaths spiked more people died during and immediately after the power outage The deaths could have been caused by many dangers of power outages people not being able to charge medical equipment not being able to use air conditioning on hot days or experiencing increased physical and mental stress and isolation of living without elevators or subways And when we studied hospitalization and mortality data around NYCs smaller blackouts in July 1999 and July 2006 we saw that localized power outages also threaten healthhttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov29894117 We found an increase in hospitalizations for respiratory disease renal kidney disease and an increase in allcause mortality deaths Climate change is likely to bring more power outages Weatherrelated power outages are increasing as climate change brings more frequent more powerful storms that threaten our power grid and other physical infrastructure The chart below from wwwclimatecentralorghttpswwwclimatecentralorg shows the increasing frequency of weatherrelated power outages over the last 20 years While there are yeartoyear differences the overall increasing trend is clear but not all NYC residents are prepared Our survey found that 58 of NYC residents have basic preparation for power outageshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC6181821 a working flashlight and a 3day supply of water and food People with household members who depend on electrical medical equipment are more likely to be prepared for power outages 70 vs 56 of respondents without electricdependent household members However even though they are more prepared they report not feeling more prepared as they face the challenge of ensuring that their medical equipment runs during power outages when you need electricity to stay healthy its hard to feel completely prepared for a blackout Stay prepared Its important for our City to build a power grid that is resilient since we expect more extreme weather as our climate continues to change As we experience this changing climate a reliable supply of electricity is crucial to support lifesaving equipment And its vital that this resiliency be equitable so that people in highpoverty neighborhoods that have been deprived of resources arent made additionally vulnerable by climate change and power outages But we can also expect some power outages so its important for residents to be prepared especially if you or somebody in your household uses medical

Pero qu significa esto especficamente Una mirada ms profunda a la historia del redlining muestra esta conexin Cuando analizamos datos sobre la salud de los neoyorquinos solemos encontrar los mismos patrones geogrficos con ndices ms altos de afecciones mdicas evitables en vecindarios con ms pobreza Por ejemplo escribimos sobre cmo el asma y la pobreza estn estrechamente relacionadas Estos

el porcentaje de la poblacin negra con el ndice de visitas infantiles por asma a la sala de emergencias representado por el tamao de cada burbuja Esta dinmica de extiende ms all del asma Para entender por qu la pobreza la raza y la salud estn relacionadas en la ciudad de Nueva York es necesario revisar el redlining Esta poltica del gobierno de la dcada de 1930 ilustra la naturaleza de la pobreza y el racismo en nuestra sociedad y muestra cmo el racismo afecta la salud Una breve historia del redlining En la dcada de 1930 durante la Gran Depresin las tasas de desempleo eran altas y muchas personas no podan pagar su hipoteca Una ola de ejecuciones hipotecarias se extendi en el pas Para ayudar a que las personas conservaran sus viviendas el gobierno federal estableci la Corporacin de Prstamos para Propietarios de Viviendas Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Su objetivo era refinanciar las hipotecas con mejores trminos como tasas de inters ms bajas y perodos de compensacin ms prolongados para ayudar a las personas a efectuar los pagos y evitar las ejecuciones hipotecarias Para determinar qu prstamos poda garantizar la HOLC envi personas a tasar vecindarios en las ciudades de los EE UU Determinaron los tipos de viviendas en los vecindarios junto con informacin sobre las personas que vivan all Tambin catalogaron las influencias perjudiciales con descripciones racistas como infiltracin de negros y razas mixtas como caractersticas que reducan el valor de un vecindario Documento de redlining que detalla las viviendas el tipo de construccin la antigedad promedio las condiciones de reparacin la ocupacin el rango de precio y otra informacin Un documento de redlining que indica lo siguiente Influencias perjudiciales Obsolescencia y mantenimiento deficiente Infiltracin de negros Estructuras elevadas en Lexington Ave y Fulton y Grand Avenue Razas mixtas Con esta informacin la HOLC diagram mapas de seguridad residencial para casi 250 ciudades incluida la ciudad de Nueva York En estos mapas la HOLC les dio a los vecindarios una clasificacin Mejores An atractivos Definitivamente en declive Peligrosos El gobierno usaba estas clasificaciones para determinar si otorgara prstamos Los bancos las usaban para determinar si las personas eran elegibles para una hipoteca y no otorgaban prstamos para comprar viviendas en los vecindarios en declive o peligrosos Esto era el redlining el establecimiento de lmites alrededor de los vecindarios segn la raza de los residentes y la privacin de recursos y oportunidades lo que efectivamente racializaba la pobreza en las ciudades de todos los EE UU Esto es el racismo estructural donde el racismo se introduce en las normas de la sociedad El mapa a continuacin muestra el alcance del redlining en la ciudad de Nueva York El redlining impuls la segregacin residencial Como resultado del redlining a las personas negras se les negaba el acceso a los vecindarios atractivos con prcticas inmobiliarias racistas y se les negaban prstamos para comprar viviendas en vecindarios catalogados como en declive o peligrosos Los agentes inmobiliarios tambin usaban tcticas explotadoras como el acoso inmobiliario la venta de contratos y los convenios racialmente restrictivos para profundizar y reforzar la segregacin en los vecindarios El acoso inmobiliario era una prctica empleada por los agentes inmobiliarios Como muchas personas blancas consideraban a las personas negras una amenaza social y econmica para sus vecindarios los agentes les decan a los propietarios blancos que haba personas negras que estaban por mudarse al vecindario Esto convenca a los propietarios de que el valor de sus viviendas descendera y vendan las propiedades a un precio ms bajo Luego los agentes inmobiliarios les vendan las propiedades a las personas negras a precios excesivos La venta de contratos era una prctica inmobiliaria engaosa y explotadora que tena como objetivo a las personas negras con prstamos privados para comprar viviendas Estos prstamos solan tener tasas de inters altas y trminos manipuladores que en algunos casos obligaban al comprador a renunciar a la vivienda si dejaba pasar apenas un pago del prstamo Por lo general estos contratos hacan que las personas debieran pagar mucho ms dinero que el valor de la vivienda que compraban Un convenio racialmente restrictivo es una clusula en el ttulo de la propiedad que evita que el propietario les venda la vivienda a personas negras Los convenios racialmente restrictivos eran una manera de imponer la segregacin residencial para garantizar que las personas negras permanecieran fuera de los vecindarios blancos Ser propietario de una vivienda es una forma poderosa de alcanzar estabilidad financiera Estas polticas concentraban a las personas negras en vecindarios privados de inversiones y no les permitan acceder a prstamos ni comprar una vivienda mientras que los residentes blancos reciban ms recursos y oportunidades Se discriminaron

        "content": " Inside the 90yearold financial policy that harms our health In public health we often cite structural racism to help explain health patterns in our society But what specifically does this mean A close look at the history of redlining shows this connection When we analyze data on the health of New Yorkers we often find the same geographic patterns with higher rates of preventable health conditions in highpoverty neighborhoods For example weve written about how asthma and poverty are closely connected These highpoverty neighborhoods are also home to a higher proportion of people of color than other communities The chart below shows the relationship between each neighborhoods poverty rate and percent population of color with the rate of childhood asthma ED visits represented by the size of each bubble This dynamic extends beyond asthma To understand why poverty race and health are related in New York City we look back at redlining This government policy from the 1930s illustrates the nature of poverty and racism in our society and how racism affects health A Brief History of Redlining In the 1930s during the Great Depression unemployment rates were high and many people couldnt make their mortgage payments A wave of foreclosures swept the country To help keep people in their homes the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Its goal was to refinance mortgages with better terms like lower interest rates and longer repayment periods to help people make payments and avoid foreclosure To determine what loans they would guarantee HOLC sent people to appraise neighborhoods in cities across the US They documented the types of housing in neighborhoods along with information about the people who lived there They also catalogued detrimental influences with racist descriptions like infiltration of Negroes and mixed races as characteristics that lowered a neighborhoods value A redlining document that details housing construction type average age repair condition occupancy price range and other information A redining document that reads Detrimental influences Obsolescence and poor maintenance Infiltration of Negroes Elevated structures on Lexington Ave Fulton Grand Avenue Mixed races With this information HOLC made residential security maps for almost 250 cities including New York City On these maps HOLC gave each neighborhood a classification Best Still desirable Definitely declining Hazardous The government used these classifications to determine whether to guarantee loans Banks used them to determine if people were eligible for mortgages and wouldnt provide loans to buy homes in the declining or hazardous neighborhoods This was redlining drawing boundaries around neighborhoods based on residents race and depriving them of resources and opportunities effectively racializing poverty in cities across the US This is structural racism where racism is built into the rules of society The map below shows the extent of redlining in New York City Redlining drove residential segregation As a result of redlining people of color were denied access to desirable neighborhoods by racist real estate practices and denied loans to buy homes in neighborhoods labeled declining or hazardous Real estate agents also used exploitative tactics like blockbusting contract selling and racially restrictive covenants to deepen and enforce neighborhood segregation Blockbusting was a practice used by real estate agents Since many white people viewed people of color as a social and economic threat to their neighborhoods agents would tell white homeowners that people of color were about to move into the neighborhood This would convince homeowners that their houses value would fall and they would sell for a lower price Real estate agents would then turn around and sell property to people of color for inflated prices Contract selling was a deceptive and exploitative real estate practice that targeted people of color with private loans to buy homes These loans often had high interests rates and manipulative terms in some cases forcing the buyer to give up their home if they missed even one loan payment These contracts often made people responsible for paying back far more money than the house they bought was worth A raciallyrestrictive covenant is a clause in the deed for a property that prevents the owner from selling the property to people of color Raciallyrestrictive covenants were a way to enforce residential segregation to ensure that people of color were kept out of white neighborhoods Owning a home is a powerful way to achieve financial stability These policies concentrated people of color in neighborhoods deprived of investment and prevented them from accessing loans and buying property while while white residents were provided more resources and opportunities Enormous areas of New York City were redlined Explore the extent of HOLCs redlining

generation to the next Neighborhoods that were redlined in the 1930s have higher rates of poverty even today nearly 90 years after the maps were created According to the National Community Reinvestment Coalitionhttpsncrcorgholc 3 out of every 4 neighborhoods in the USA that were redlined in the 1930s are still lowtomoderate income today and 2 out of every 3 are predominantly populated by people of color Redlining is a prime example of neighborhood disinvestment denying or withholding public and private funding city services or other resources that neighborhoods and their residents need to thrive When these resources are withheld it creates environments that make people sickhttpswwwwhointhdppovertyen Disinvestment can be Denying people loans to buy homes like through redlining and other welldocumented racist real estate practices Housing neglect by landlords leading to unhealthy housing A decline in public funding for housing schools and other vital services Fewer job opportunities and lowerpaying jobs Emphasis on policing over prosocial resources Policies like redlining show us that poverty isnt a bit of bad luck inability to find a good job or not working hard enough Poverty is deeper and more powerful generations of deprivation and disinvestment withholding resources opportunity wealth and health from people and neighborhoods often driven by racism Though redlining was banned in 1968 other forms of housing discrimination persist But redlining was special because of how it worsened poverty and segregation in cities across the United States leaving a legacy of income and racial disparities in health outcomes Public health is about far more than changing peoples behaviors at the individual level its about building a society that supports health and

hospitalizations This is intuitive actually denser traffic means slower speeds resulting in safer streets for cyclists Now lets look at the number of cyclists on NYC streets When we map cycling in New

bike lanes but in Brooklyn only 13 percent of streets do This is consistent with research that shows that bicycle networks offer protection to people on the streets Safety in numbers The idea of safety in numbers comes from a study that found that a motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle This is probably because as the number of people walking and cycling increases motorists become more attentive So as the number of cyclists rises we expect to see injury rates go down Ongoing work to promote cycling will help lower injury rates Expanding bike share networks increasing bicycle network coverage and continuing to build protective street environments like separated bike lanes can get more riders on the street and offer them greater protection This effect is apparent when we look at differences between Manhattan and Brooklyn and apply what we learn throughout the city Disparities in cycling by sex raceethnicity age and neighborhood poverty also need to be addressed through equitably focused safety improvements since safety in numbers works best if we increase safety for everyone starting where it is most needed As New York City continues to grapple with the COVID19 pandemic many New Yorkers may turn to biking as a good way to get around while still keeping a safe distance from others Our data show us that there is a clear connection between road infrastructure and street safety That means that one way to keep New Yorkers safe during this public health emergency and beyond is to continue building safer

ndice de homicidios en la ciudad de Nueva York se redujo Hay mucha menos violencia que la que sola haber en la ciudad de Nueva York Nota sobre la pandemia de la COVID19 No se incluyen aqu datos de 2020 pero desde el comienzo de la pandemia de la COVID19 en la ciudad de Nueva York se ha observado un aumento en las agresiones los tiroteos y las visitas a la sala de emergencias y hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales A nivel nacional tambin se han observado patrones similares ya que el pas experimenta ndices de desempleo sin precedentes inseguridad edilicia y alimentaria inestabilidad poltica e incertidumbre sobre el futuro Los factores sociales econmicos y ambientales que pueden influir en los ndices de violencia han aumentado durante esta crisis histrica Para analizar la violencia las personas por lo general observan los ndices de homicidio En los ltimos aos el ndice de homicidios de la ciudad de Nueva York los episodios de violencia ms extremos ha estado por debajo de 5 por cada 100000 personas de un mximo de ms de 25 por cada 100000 personas desde 1986 hasta 1990 pero la reduccin en el ndice de homicidios no cuenta toda la historia En esta tabla observamos tres tipos de consecuencias violentas y cmo los niveles de violencia varan en la ciudad visitas a la sala de emergencias por agresiones no mortales hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales y homicidios Estos datos muestran una mayor carga de violencia Cuando se desglosan segn la geografa los datos muestran que algunos vecindarios tienen ndices de violencia mucho ms altos que otros Los vecindarios con mayor violencia tienen ndices de hospitalizacin por agresiones no mortales que son 10 veces ms altos que los vecindarios con los ndices ms bajos y 4 veces ms altos que el ndice de toda la ciudad Este patrn se mantiene en los tres indicadores Adems los vecindarios con ndices ms altos de violencia tienen poblaciones ms grandes de personas negras lo que muestra que estas poblaciones asumen una carga desproporcionada de violencia Un enfoque de salud pblica para abordar la violencia Los residentes de algunos vecindarios corren un riesgo mucho mayor de sufrir violencia y sus muchos efectos en la salud Para prevenir la violencia entre las personas ms afectadas debemos analizar los factores que conducen a ella La violencia est arraigada en la falta de inversin y el racismo histricos La evidencia muestra que la violencia es el resultado de estructuras sociales que limitan el acceso a las necesidades bsicas son estructuras impulsadas por el racismo la segregacin residencial y la falta de inversin en los vecindarios En los lugares en los que persisten estas estructuras las personas estn expuestas a la violencia Por ejemplo se conoce que los vecindarios negros de bajos ingresos son los ms afectados Este mapa muestra las reas de la ciudad de Nueva York que fueron discriminadas por el redlining hace 90 aos como parte de una poltica edilicia racista que ocasion dcadas de falta de inversin y pobreza intergeneracional El redlining fue una poltica federal que comenz en la dcada de 1930 Una agencia gubernamental diagram mapas de cientos de ciudades de todos los EE UU y clasific a los vecindarios de mejores a peligrosos Sus criterios incluan la raza de las personas que vivan en estos vecindarios Tanto el gobierno federal como los bancos privados usaban estos mapas para determinar si podan o no emitir prstamos para que las personas compraran viviendas A travs de este sistema a las personas negras se les negaba la oportunidad de comprar viviendas y las personas blancas compraban sus viviendas con subsidios federales El redlining impuls la segregacin y la desigualdad econmica en lneas raciales Sus efectos persisten en la actualidad Segn la Coalicin Nacional de Reinversin Comunitaria National Community Reinvestment Coalition 3 de cada 4 vecindarios en los EE UU que fueron discriminados en la dcada de 1930 an son de ingresos bajos a moderados en la actualidad y 2 de cada 3 poseen una poblacin mayoritariamente negra Un mapa de los tiroteos recientes se alinea con las reas considerablemente discriminadas por el redlining del Bronx Harlem y el norte y el este de Brooklyn lo que muestra con claridad cmo la violencia actual est estrechamente relacionada con las formas en que las polticas racistas estn integradas en nuestra sociedad Las dcadas de falta de inversin del gobierno y la sociedad que surgen de prcticas como el redlining hacen referencia a oportunidades y recursos limitados y resultan en mayores ndices de pobreza en algunos vecindarios La falta de inversin se da cuando las agencias gubernamentales o las empresas privadas niegan o retiran recursos y oportunidades de forma deliberada a un vecindario o una comunidad La historia de la falta de inversin est vinculada con prcticas y polticas racistas como negarles prstamos a las personas negras para comprar viviendas La falta de inversin tambin es una disminucin planificada un descenso estable de los fondos pblicos para viviendas servicios y educacin de carcter pblico en especial en ciudades y en vecindarios con una poblacin mayormente negra Como resultado de esta falta de inversin vemos una clara relacin entre la pobreza y la violencia Cuando el nivel de pobreza de un vecindario aumenta las agresiones tambin lo hacen La falta de inversin crea entornos que atentan contra la salud La falta de inversin adopta muchas formas Promueve la segregacin limita el acceso de las personas a recursos bsicos y crea entornos que atentan contra la salud La falta de inversin puede darse mediante lo siguiente Negarles a las personas el acceso a prstamos para comprar viviendas como el redlining y otras prcticas inmobiliarias racistas bien documentadas Negligencia edilicia por parte de los arrendadores lo que hace que las viviendas sean insalubres Escuelas con fondos insuficientes Menos oportunidades laborales y empleos con menor remuneracin nfasis en las polticas por sobre los recursos prosociales En trminos de salud pblica decimos que la falta de inversin genera factores ambientales que hacen que sean ms probables determinadas consecuencias en la salud Factores ambientales Consecuencias en la salud Debido a una historia de falta de inversin los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York experimentan factores ambientales muy diferentes que predicen violencia y otras consecuencias en la salud Al decir ambiental nos referimos a todo el contexto fsico social y econmico que nos rodea el entorno construido como las viviendas y los parques y el acceso a escuelas empleos oportunidades atencin mdica y ms El hecho de que un vecindario experimente o no ms violencia se puede explicar observando si su entorno tiene factores de proteccin que ayudan a prevenir la violencia antes de que comience o factores de riesgo que hacen que la violencia sea una consecuencia ms probable Los factores de proteccin incluyen los siguientes nbspSalud infantil nbspEstabilidad econmica nbspEducacin de buena calidad nbspEstabilidad edilicia Los factores de riesgo incluyen los siguientes nbspPobreza y pobreza infantil nbspInestabilidad econmica nbspInestabilidad edilicia nbspSufrir traumas o violencia Qu significa esto para los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York Los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York experimentan estos factores de proteccin y de riesgo de forma muy diferentes Algunos vecindarios carecen de muchos factores de proteccin y en su lugar tienen muchos ms factores de riesgo Analicemos cmo se da esto comparando dos vecindarios BelmontEast Tremont en el Bronx y TottenvilleGreat Kills en Staten Island La pobreza vara entre el 62 y el 415 en los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York BelmontEast Tremont tiene uno de los ndices de pobreza ms altos de la ciudad mientras que TottenvilleGreat Kills tiene uno de los ms bajos La pobreza en los vecindarios es uno de los factores ambientales que pueden predecir la violencia ya que en los vecindarios con ndices de pobreza ms altos tambin es ms probable que haya ndices altos de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales BelmontEast Tremont tambin tiene un ndice alto de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales uno de los ms altos de la ciudad 107 por cada 100000 personas TottenvilleGreat Kills sigue el mismo patrn con uno de los ndices ms bajos de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales solo 15 por cada 100000 personas Otra forma de comparar los ndices de pobreza y violencia es clasificar a los vecindarios del ms alto al ms bajo y comparar sus posiciones A continuacin podemos ver que BelmontEast Tremont est en el rango alto de pobreza y agresiones mientras que TottenvilleGreat Kills est en el rango bajo para ambos Cuando agregamos otros factores de riesgo emerge un patrn ms significativo A continuacin cada lnea vertical representa los rangos de los vecindarios para los factores de riesgo de pobreza total pobreza infantil desamparo

vecindarios con los ndices de pobreza ms bajos que tienen un rango sistemtico bajo en los factores de riesgo experimentan menos violencia Por qu ocurre esto Estos factores de riesgo conforman una red de amenazas ambientales en comunidades que han sufrido falta de inversin Debido a la distribucin desigual de recursos y oportunidades algunos vecindarios enfrentan una cantidad desproporcionada de riesgos Estas amenazas llevan a los residentes a la pobreza y los exponen a riesgos durante todas sus vidas lo que culmina en ndices ms altos de violencia En los entornos donde los factores de riesgo superan ampliamente los factores de proteccin emergen ndices ms altos de violencia en los vecindarios que amenazan la salud de sus residentes nbspAcerca de los datos Romper el crculo de violencia

previenen la violencia y abordar las consecuencias generadas por la violencia Significa trabajar en todos los sistemas y las comunidades para volver a invertir en los vecindarios ms afectados por la

violencia Nos estamos asociando con las comunidades para responder a las crisis de salud mental y los eventos traumticos en los vecindarios a travs de evaluacin y respuesta rpidas Con este trabajo el Departamento de Salud est reinvirtiendo en las comunidades que han sufrido falta de inversin para que podamos crear entornos donde los factores de proteccin superen a los factores de riesgo para reducir los ndices de violencia La salud pblica consiste en garantizar condiciones en las que las personas puedan estar saludables Un enfoque de salud pblica con respecto a la violencia depende de una respuesta de todos los sectores de la sociedad para abordar las desigualdades que conducen a la violencia Depende de la creacin y el apoyo de sistemas para que las instituciones y los vecindarios respalden la salud de sus residentes Un enfoque de salud pblica con respecto a la violencia presenta la oportunidad de encontrar soluciones sostenibles para crear espacios saludables donde los

emotional and psychological trauma Violence doesnt just affect the immediate victim it affects their surrounding community too Violence can affect people throughout their lives it is associated with worse birth outcomes childhood developmental delays physical and mental illness and premature deaths Violence is an epidemic and with any epidemic prevention is key And like any health issue that leads to disability disease and death there is a role for public health and healthcare to play in preventing it A common understanding of violence can help promote public health approaches to violence prevention and shift the focus from violence as a criminal behavior to instead viewing the experience of violence as a public health issue Yes violence is a behavior that some people do but were focused on how people experience violence the social and environmental contexts that predict whether they do what happens as a result and how we can protect them We can use data and research to understand what leads to violence to advocate for and help implement strategies to reduce peoples exposure to violence to keep them safe and prevent lifelong harm to their health nbspAre you or is somebody you know affected by violence Help is available and you dont have to go through it alone Call 1888NYCWELL 18886929355 for a free confidential help line for New York City residents Background on violence in New York City NYCs homicide rate has declined There is a lot less violence than there used to be in NYC Note on the COVID19 pandemic Data for 2020 is not included here but since the start of the COVID19 pandemic NYC has seen an increase in assaults shooting incidents and nonfatal assault emergency room visits and hospitalizations Similar patterns have been observed nationally as the country experiences unprecedented unemployment housing and food insecurity political unrest and uncertainty about the future The social economic and environmental factors that can influence violence rates have been amplified during this historic crisis To look at violence people often look at homicide rates In recent years NYCs rate of homicides the most extreme episodes of violence has been under 5 per 100000 people down from a high of over 25 per 100000 people from 19861990 but a drop in the homicide rate doesnt tell the whole story In this chart we look at three types of violent outcomes and how violence levels differ across the city nonfatal assault emergency department visits nonfatal assault hospitalizations and homicides These data show a larger burden of violence When broken down by geography the data show that some neighborhoods experience violence at much higher rates than others Neighborhoods experiencing the most violence have nonfatal assault hospitalization rates that are 10 times higher than neighborhoods experiencing the lowest rates and 4 times higher than the citywide rate This pattern is consistent across the three indicators And neighborhoods that experience higher rates of violence have larger populations of people of color showing that these populations shoulder a disproportionate burden of violence A public health approach to addressing violence Residents of some neighborhoods are at much greater risk of experiencing violence and its many health effects To prevent violence among those most affected by it we need to explore what factors lead to it Violence is rooted in historical disinvestment and racism Evidence shows that violence results from social structures that limit access to basic needs structures that are fueled by racism residential segregation and neighborhood disinvestment Where these structures persist people are exposed to violence For example lowincome neighborhoods of color are known to be hit the hardest This map shows the parts of NYC that were redlined 90 years ago as part of racist housing policy that set off decades of disinvestment and intergenerational poverty Redlining was a federal policy that started in the 1930s A government agency drew maps of hundreds of cities throughout the USA and graded neighborhoods within them from Best to Hazardous Their criteria included the race of people who lived in those neighborhoods Both the federal government and private banks used these maps to determine whether or not to back loans so that people could buy homes Through this system people of color were denied the opportunity to buy homes and white people had their home purchases federally subsidized Redlining drove segregation and economic inequality along racial lines Its effects persist today According to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 3 out of every 4 neighborhoods in the USA that were redlined in the 1930s are still lowtomoderate income today and 2 out of every 3 are predominantly populated by people of color A map of recent shootings lines up with the heavily redlined areas of the Bronx Harlem and northern and eastern Brooklyn showing clearly how todays violence is closely related to the ways that racist policies are embedded in our society Decades of government and societal disinvestment from practices like redlining means limited opportunity and resources and results in higher rates of poverty in some neighborhoods Disinvestment is when either government agencies or private companies deliberately withhold or withdraw resources and opportunity from a neighborhood or community The history of disinvesment is tied to racist practices and policies like denyng people of color loans to buy homes Disinvestment is also planned shrinkage a steady decline of public funding for public housing services education especially in cities and especially in neighborhoods populated mostly by people of color As a result of this disinvestment we see a clear relationship between poverty and violence As a neighborhoods poverty level increases so do assaults Disinvestment creates environments that threaten health Disinvestment takes many forms It promotes segregation limits peoples access to basic resources and creates environments that threaten peoples health Disinvestment can be Denying people access to loans to buy homes like redlining and other welldocumented racist real estate practices Housing neglect by landlords leading to unhealthy housing Poorlyfunded schools Fewer job opportunities and lowerpaying jobs Emphasis on policing over prosocial resources In terms of public health we say that disinvestment produces environmental factors that make certain health outcomes more likely Environmental factors Health outcomes Due to a history of disinvestment New York City neighborhoods experience very different environmental factors that predict violence and other health outcomes By environmental we mean the entire physical social and economic context around us the built environment like housing and parks and access to schools jobs opportunity healthcare and more Whether or not a neighborhood experiences more violence can be explained by looking at whether its environment has protective factors which help prevent violence before it starts or risk factors which make violence a more likely outcome Protective factors include nbspChild health nbspEconomic stability nbspHigh quality education nbspHousing stability Risk factors include nbspPoverty and child poverty nbspEconomic instability nbspHousing instability nbspExperiencing trauma or violence What does this mean for NYCs neighborhoods NYCs neighborhoods experience these protective and risk factors very differently Some neighborhoods have a lot less of the protective factors and a lot more of the risk factors Lets explore how by comparing two neighborhoods BelmontEast Tremont in the Bronx and TottenvilleGreat Kills in Staten Island Poverty ranges from 62 to 415 among NYC neighborhoods BelmontEast Tremont has one of the highest poverty rates in the city while TottenvilleGreat Kills has one of the lowest Neighborhood poverty is one of the environmental factors that can predict violence with neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty more likely to also have high rates of nonfatal assault hospitalizations BelmontEast Tremont also has a high rate of nonfatal assault hospitalizations one of the highest in the city 107 per 100000 people TottenvilleGreat Kills follows the same pattern with one of the lowest rates of nonfatal assault hospitalizations only 15 per 100000 people Another way to compare poverty and violence rates is to rank neighborhoods from highest to lowest for each and compare their positions Below we can see that BelmontEast Tremont ranks high in both poverty and assaults while TottenvilleGreat Kills ranks low for both When we add in other risk factors an even more significant pattern emerges Below each vertical line represents the neighborhood rankings for the risk factors of total poverty child poverty child homelessness high school incompletion disconnected youth unemployment evictions foreclosures and the violent outcome of assault hospitalizations shootings and homicides Each line connects one neighborhood through its ranks the flatter the line the more consistent the ranks These risk factors describe a network of threatening environmental factors in communities that have experienced disinvestment place residents in poverty and expose them to risks throughout their lives culminating in higher rates of violence Environmental factors in the chart below Child wellbeing Poverty child poverty and child homelessness Education and employment high school incompletion

data BelmontEast Tremont ranks highly for these risk factors that make violence more likely By comparison TottenvilleGreat Kills ranks low for these factors nbspAbout the data A pattern emerges neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates consistently rank high for risk factors experience more violence Neighborhoods with the lowest poverty rates consistently rank low for risk factors experience less violence Why does this happen These risk factors make up a network of environmental threats in communities that have experienced disinvestment Due to the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities some neighborhoods face a disproportionate amount of risk These threats place residents in poverty and expose them to risks throughout their lives culminating in higher rates of violence In environments where risk factors far outweigh protective factors higher rates of neighborhood violence emerge and threaten the health of residents of these neighborhoods nbspAbout the data Breaking the cycle of violence Addressing factors that lead to violence The Health Department takes a public health approach to violence This means promoting conditions that prevent violence and addressing outcomes triggered by violence It means working across systems and communities to reinvest in neighborhoods most affected by violence This work includes Research on the most effective policies to reduce violence collecting and analyzing data that can be used to develop new interventions Through the Crisis Management Systemhttpswww1nycgovsitepeacenycinterventionscrisismanagementpage working with other city organizations to support communityled efforts to deescalate violence providing support to atrisk youth with employment legal therapeutic and educational opportunities Strengthening the Neighborhood Health Action Centers in the South Bronx Harlem and Central Brooklyn neighborhoods that all experience higher levels of violence The Action Centers serve as community hubs for programs and resources that can decrease risk and increase protective factors Working with hospitals to help them respond to the many needs physical social and emotional of people injured by violence Partnering with communities to respond to neighborhoodlevel mental health crises and traumatic events through Rapid Assessment and Response With this work the Health Department is reinvesting in communities that have experienced disinvestment so that we can build environments where protective factors outweigh risk factors to reduce rates of violence Public health is about assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy A public health approach to violence prevention relies on a response from all sectors of society to address the inequities that lead to violence It relies on creating and supporting systems so that both institutions and neighborhoods support the health of their residents A public health approach to violence presents an opportunity to find sustainable solutions to create healthy spaces for New Yorkers to live and thrive It means that we can prevent violence by eliminating poverty providing jobs healthy housing and education creating a society based on justice and equality that offers opportunity to all nbspAre you or is somebody you know affected by violence Help is available and you dont have to go through it alone Call 1888NYCWELL 18886929355
