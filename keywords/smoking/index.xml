      <description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a group of diseases that include emphysemia and chronic bronchitis.
These diseases can cause severe breathing problems. Over 16 million Americans have COPD, and it is the third-leading cause of death in the USA.
Though there is no cure for COPD, it can be treated and managed. One important way to manage COPD is to reduce environmental exposure to things that can exacerbate COPD, like tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution.</description>

      <description>Smoking causes over a dozen cancers, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and many other diseases; it remains a leading cause of death in New York City (NYC). On average, people who do not smoke live about 10 years longer than people who do.
Additionally, there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes cancer, heart disease and other illnesses in adults. Children exposed to smoke are more likely to have bronchitis, asthma attacks, ear infections, pneumonia and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</description>
