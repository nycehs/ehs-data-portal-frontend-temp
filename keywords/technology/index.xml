      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re making changes, and we need your help.
A few months ago, when we redesigned the home page of the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, we wrote that we were working toward &amp;ldquo;building a system that works: thatâ€™s intuitive and makes our information clear and easy-to-find.&amp;rdquo;
As a government agency, we&amp;rsquo;re committed to making information available via the web. By doing this well, we hope that people can use this information to change their lives and their communities.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular to the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, then you may notice that we&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes to our home page. We&amp;rsquo;ve kept most of the Portal&amp;rsquo;s functions the same, but we&amp;rsquo;ve rearranged things, and want to tell you about them.
Before After Why&amp;rsquo;d we make these changes? Well, for a few reasons:
To highlight our best tools and resources. We want our home page to make it clear what this site is all about, and draw attention to our top tools: our Data Explorer, Neighborhood Reports, and Data Stories.</description>
