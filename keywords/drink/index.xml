      <title>Drinking Water Quality</title>

      <description>All NYC residences receive drinking water from a public water system. Most water is gravity fed from a network of reservoirs and lakes in protected watersheds, up to 125 miles from the city (view map).
The NYC water system consists of two surface water systems (Croton and Catskill/Delaware) and a Southwestern Queens ground water system. Since 1999, the Croton system has served as a supplemental water system, and the Catskill/Delaware reservoir system has supplied almost all NYC drinking water.</description>

      <description>New York City has approximately 24,000 restaurants that the Health Department inspects every year to monitor compliance with city and state food safety regulations. At the end of an inspection, the Health Department gives restaurants a score, which is eventually converted to a grade of A, B or C. This site describes the distribution of A grades across New York City restaurants.
Restaurant Food Safety and Health Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness.</description>

      <title>Sugary Drink Consumption</title>
      <link>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/sugary-drink-consumption/</link>

      <description>Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, long-term weight gain, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional value, and because they don’t fill you up the way food does, you end up consuming more calories. Also, food and beverage portion sizes have exploded over the past several decades, and studies have shown that when given larger portions, people consume more without recognizing it.</description>

      <description>OneNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.
Goal: Ensure the high quality and reliability of our water supply system.
Drinking Water Quality If the NYC water network is properly maintained and operated, then we expect it to deliver consistently clean and potable water throughout the city. To ensure that our water supply is potable, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) collects approximately 15,000 drinking water samples and performs approximately 200,000 analyses of water quality annually.</description>

      <description>We all make choices around food and drink, but sometimes, those choices are made for us by our food environments.
Our food environments include neighborhood-level alcohol access, unhealthy food access, and restaurant food safety. Additionally, drinking water quality data includes data on contaminants that are most frequently found at levels that may be of public health significant in the country&amp;rsquo;s drinking water.</description>
