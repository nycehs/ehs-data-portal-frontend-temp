      <description>Most people spend most of their time at home - so the household environment can significantly affect health. Disrepair that stems from longterm maintenance neglect can lead to serious health problems, including: lead poisoning from lead paint; asthma and other respiratory issues triggered by pests; and carbon monoxide poisoning.
In NYC, substandard housing is disproportionately located in low-income neighborhoods, as historical disinvestment lead to severe, systemic maintenance deficiencies that threatens people&amp;rsquo;s health.</description>

      <description>Asthma is a common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest. The exact causes of asthma are not known. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled.
Asthma is a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed school days in New York City&amp;rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. In NYC, asthma is more common among low-income Black and Latino children.</description>

      <description>Bed bugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.</description>

      <guid>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/childhood-lead-exposure/</guid>
      <description>Childhood lead poisoning is a serious but preventable public health problem. Lead is a toxic metal that can cause learning and behavior problems, and delay physical growth and mental development. Testing for lead poisoning is a key component of childhood lead poisoning prevention, since most children with elevated blood lead levels exhibit no symptoms.
This site provides data on blood lead testing and on elevated blood lead levels among NYC children.</description>

      <description>Cockroaches, or just &amp;ldquo;roaches&amp;rdquo;, are a common urban pest. Though there are more than a thousand species of roaches, just a few are found in NYC homes. The most common are American Cockroaches, typically found in moist basements and lower floors, and German Cockroaches, found anywhere inside homes.
Cockroaches like warm, dark places such as toasters, clocks, microwave ovens, walls, and cabinets. They need regular access to food and water to live and breed.</description>

      <guid>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/falls-among-older-adults/</guid>
      <description>Each year, one in three older adults (65 years and older) falls. Among New York City&amp;rsquo;s older adults, there are approximately 30,500 emergency department (ED) visits, 16,600 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths each year. Falls are not a normal part of aging, and research shows that many falls can be prevented.
Falls and the environment Although falls can occur anywhere, falls among older adults frequently happen at home. More than one-half of fall-related hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home.</description>

      <description>No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing. All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury.
In New York City, substandard or poor housing tends to cluster in neighborhoods. Homes that are deteriorating or dilapidated, or homes near buildings with broken or boarded-up windows, disproportionately tend to be in low-income neighborhoods, although the differences for these indicators have decreased.
Housing and Health Housing quality impacts health directly and indirectly.</description>

      <title>Lead Hazards</title>
      <link>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/lead-hazards/</link>

      <guid>https://nycehs.github.io/ehs-data-portal-frontend-temp/data-explorer/lead-hazards/</guid>
      <description>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978. Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips, peels or is abraded, or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust.</description>

      <description>Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.
Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.
This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings.</description>

      <description>Social and economic conditions affect people’s health. These conditions (also called “social determinants of health”) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives. They are shaped by local, national and global distribution of resources and power.
People tend to be healthier when they have access to:
 Economic and financial stability Higher education Adequate health care Healthy neighborhoods and safe, strong communities  But when people don’t have access to these conditions, they experience worse health outcomes.</description>

      <description>Inside the 90-year-old financial policy that harms our health In public health, we often cite structural racism to help explain health patterns in our society. But what, specifically, does this mean? A close look at the history of redlining shows this connection.
When we analyze data on the health of New Yorkers, we often find the same geographic patterns, with higher rates of preventable health conditions in high-poverty neighborhoods. For example, we&amp;rsquo;ve written about how asthma and poverty are closely connected.</description>

But you may not think about how your home affects your health- and you may not think about the factors that influence where you live.For a home to be healthy, it should be free of:CracksHolesLeaksSmokePestsOld, peeling paintIn other words, a healthy home is a well-maintained home.</description>

      <description>Poverty affects health in many ways. In New York City, the story of asthma clearly illustrates this connection.
To understand the connection between poverty and asthma, take a look at this map of poverty rates in New York City, below. The darker the color, the more residents living in poverty.
