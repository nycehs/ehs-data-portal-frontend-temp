      <description>Social and economic conditions affect people’s health. These conditions (also called “social determinants of health”) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives. They are shaped by local, national and global distribution of resources and power.
People tend to be healthier when they have access to economic and financial stability, higher education, adequate health care, healthy neighborhoods, and safe, strong communities.</description>

      <description>Usingpublic health to prevent violenceExperiencing violence affects people in many ways. It not only causes physicalinjury or death, but being exposed to it can also cause emotional andpsychological trauma. Violence doesn’tjust affect the immediate victim, it affects their surrounding community, too.Violence can affect people throughout their lives: it is associated with worsebirth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, andpremature deaths.</description>
