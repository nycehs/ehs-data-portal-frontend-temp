**Air quality can vary** **from neighborhood to neighborhood**. That is why the **New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS)**keeps track of street-level air pollution from about 100 locations throughout New York City every season. NYCCAS is part of [OneNYC](http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html "OneNYC"), New York City's long-term plan for sustainability.

The pollutants we measure are: [fine particulate matter](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx?#Fine_particulate_matter) (PM2.5), [ground-level ozone (O3, summer)](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Ground_level_ozone%20), [nitrogen oxides (NOx)](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nitrogen_oxides), black carbon from diesel exhaust, [sulfur dioxide (SO2, winter)](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Sulfur_dioxide) and [nickel (Ni, winter)](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nickel).

In NYC, levels of fine particulate matter, black carbon, and sulfur dioxide are higher in high-poverty neighborhoods.

### Neighborhood Air Quality and Health

Pollutants may have negative effects on health, including:

* **Breathing problems**, such as coughing, and tightness in the chest
* **Acute respiratory problems**, such as worsening of [asthma](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page "Asthma") and reduced lung function
* **Increased risk of heart attack** and **stroke**
* **Low birthweight** in newborns

Air pollution may affect anyone, but **certain groups are more vulnerable** to risks, including:

* **Older adults**
* **Children**
* **People with heart and respiratory conditions**

### To Reduce Health Risks

* Know how **sensitive you are to air pollution**, and keep track of your local [Air Quality Index](http://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/aqi/aqi_forecast.cfm "Air quality index") (AQI). Avoid strenuous physical activity or going outside on poor air quality days.
* **Reduce pollutant emissions** by walking, biking, or using mass transit instead of a car, especially during rush hour.
* **Support policies** that promote public transportation and energy conservation.
