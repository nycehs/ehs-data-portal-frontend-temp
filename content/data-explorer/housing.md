No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing. **All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury.**

In New York City, substandard or poor housing tends to cluster in neighborhoods. Homes that are deteriorating or dilapidated, or homes near buildings with broken or boarded-up windows, disproportionately tend to be in low-income neighborhoods, although the differences for these indicators have decreased.

### Housing and Health

Housing quality impacts health directly and indirectly. Cracks, holes, plumbing disrepair, peeling paint and other housing maintenance deficiencies are associated with:

* Increase likelihood of **pest infestations**, which can worsen **[asthma](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page "Asthma")**
* Exposure to lead where lead paint is present, which may cause **[serious health problems](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-prevention.page "lead poisoning ")**
* Promotion of **mold growth**, which may cause **allergic reactions**

Additionally, occupants' or landlords' efforts to control these conditions through the use of hazardous chemical products can increase the **risk of poisoning in the home**. Disrepair may also cause **injuries**, including slips and falls, scalding and electrical shocks. 

### To Reduce Health Risks

All building owners are required by law to provide essential services such as heat and hot water, make timely repairs, and maintain a pest-free building. 

If you are a tenant:
* **Report housing conditions** such as peeling paint, water leaks, pest problems and mold to property owners. If landlords fail to fix the problems, call 311.
* Use household cleaning products safely.
* **Provide a smoke-free home** and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
* Inform the building's owner to have **window guards installed** if there is a child under the age of 11 living in a home. If landlords fail to install the required window guards, call 311.
* **Test your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors** and **replace batteries** at least twice a year.

If you are a homeowner or a landlord:

* Property owners are **required by NYC law to install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detectors** in residential units. Working detectors should be audible from any bedroom.
* **Owners must provide homes and buildings free of pests**, and employ pest control that uses preventive measures — not just pesticides.
