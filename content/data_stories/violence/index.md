                    <p>Experiencing violence affects people in many ways. It not only causes physical
                        injury or death, but being exposed to it can also cause emotional and
                        psychological trauma. Violence doesn’t
                        just affect the immediate victim, it affects their surrounding community, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>Violence can affect people throughout their lives: it is associated with worse
                        birth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, and
                        premature deaths.</p>
                    <p>Violence is an epidemic, and with any epidemic, prevention is key. And like any
                        health issue that leads to disability, disease and death, there is a role for
                        public health and
                        healthcare to play in preventing it. </p>
                    <p>A common understanding of violence can help promote public health approaches to
                        violence prevention, and shift the focus from violence as a criminal behavior to
                        instead viewing the experience of violence as a public health issue. Yes,
                        violence is a behavior that some people do – but we’re focused on how people
                        <em>experience</em> violence: the social and environmental contexts that predict
                        whether they do, what happens as a result, and how we can protect them.
                    </p>
                    <p>We can use data and research to understand what leads to violence, to advocate
                        for and help implement strategies to reduce people’s exposure to violence - to
                        keep them safe and prevent lifelong harm to their health. </p>

                        <p>Similar patterns have been observed nationally as the country experiences

                        rate of homicides - the most extreme episodes of violence - has been under 5 per
                        100,000 people, down from a high of over 25 per 100,000 people from 1986-1990.

                    <p> In this chart, we look at three types of violent outcomes and how violence
                        levels differ across the city: non-fatal assault emergency department visits,
                        non-fatal assault hospitalizations, and homicides. These data show a larger
                        burden of violence.</p>
                    <p>When broken down by geography, the data show that some neighborhoods experience
                        violence at much higher rates than others. Neighborhoods experiencing the most
                        violence have non-fatal assault hospitalization rates that are <strong>10 times
                            higher</strong> than neighborhoods experiencing the lowest rates – and
                        <strong>4 times higher</strong> than the citywide rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>This pattern is consistent across the three indicators. And, neighborhoods that
                        experience higher rates of violence have larger populations of people of color -
                        showing that these populations shoulder a disproportionate burden of violence.

        <p>Residents of some neighborhoods are at much greater risk of experiencing violence - and its
            many health effects.</p>
        <p>To prevent violence among those most affected by it, we need to explore what factors lead to
            it.</p>
        <h3>Violence is rooted in historical disinvestment and racism.</h3>
        <p>Evidence shows that violence results from social structures that limit access to basic needs
            - structures that are fueled by racism, residential segregation, and neighborhood
            disinvestment. Where these structures persist, people are exposed to violence. For example,
            low-income
            neighborhoods of color are known to be hit the hardest.</p>
        <p>This map shows the parts of NYC that were <a href="#redliningCollapse" data-toggle="collapse"
                class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">redlined</a> 90 years ago as part of racist
            housing policy that set off decades of disinvestment and intergenerational poverty.</p>
        <div class="collapse mb-2 drawerbg px-2 py-2 mx-2" id="redliningCollapse">
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color:#7e0000">Redlining</span> was a federal policy that
                started in the 1930s. A government agency drew maps of hundreds of cities throughout the
                USA, and graded neighborhoods within them from "Best" to "Hazardous." Their criteria
                included the race of people who lived in those neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>Both the federal government and private banks used these maps to determine whether or not
                to back loans so that people could buy homes. Through this system, people of color were
                denied the opportunity to buy homes, and white people had their home purchases federally
                subsidized. </p>
            <p>Redlining drove segregation and economic inequality - along racial lines. <a
                    href="/IndicatorPublic/Closerlook/housing/index.html">Its
                    effects persist today</a>. According to the <a
                    href="https://ncrc.org/holc/">National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a>, 3 out
                of every 4 neighborhoods in the USA that were redlined in the 1930s are still
                low-to-moderate income today - and 2 out of every 3 are predominantly populated by
                people of color.</p>

                of color loans to buy homes. Disinvestment is also planned shrinkage, a steady decline
                of public funding for public housing, services, education - especially in cities, and
                especially in neighborhoods populated mostly by people of color.</p>

        <h4>Why does this happen?</h4>
        <p>These risk factors make up a network of environmental threats in communities that have
            experienced disinvestment. Due to the inequitable distribution of resources and
            opportunities, some neighborhoods face a disproportionate amount of risk. These threats
            place residents in poverty and expose them to risks throughout their lives – culminating in
            higher rates of violence.</p>
        <p>In environments where risk factors far outweigh protective factors, higher rates of
            neighborhood violence emerge - and threaten the health of residents of these neighborhoods.

        <p>Public health is about assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy. </p>
        <p>A public health approach to violence prevention relies on a response from all sectors of
            society to address the inequities that lead to violence. It relies on creating and

        <p>It means that we can prevent violence by eliminating poverty, providing jobs, healthy
