The NYC Environment & Health Data Portal shows how environments affect health, by publishing data and information that explain the connection. 

The Environment & Health Data Portal is a project by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. We are a part of the [National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showHome.action), an effort led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to share data and analyze trends in environmental public health across the nation.

Public health professionals, community-based organizations, community boards, city agencies, elected officials, health workers, advocates, and everyday New Yorkers use this website to get important information that they need to do their jobs and make important, informed decisions about health.
